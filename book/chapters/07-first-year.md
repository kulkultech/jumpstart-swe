# Chapter 7: The 1st Year

You got the offer. You signed the papers. You've cleared your calendar and set your alarm for that first day. Congratulations—you're about to start your new role as a software engineer.

But here's the thing: getting the job is just the beginning. What you do in your first year will shape not just how others see you, but how quickly you advance, what opportunities come your way, and ultimately, whether you'll look back at this role as a launching pad or a stepping stone you wish you'd used better.

I've seen brilliant engineers stumble in their first year because they focused on the wrong things. And I've seen average programmers accelerate their careers by playing the first year strategically. The difference? Understanding that your first year isn't just about writing code—it's about building credibility, establishing relationships, and positioning yourself for growth.

Let me share what I wish someone had told me when I started my first real software engineering role.

## The First 90 Days: Your Critical Window

If there's one lesson I want you to burn into your brain, it's this: **the first 90 days are everything**.

This isn't just my opinion—HR professionals and managers universally agree that the impression you make in your first three months tends to stick. Make a strong start, and people will give you the benefit of the doubt when things get tough. Stumble early, and you'll spend months fighting to change perceptions.

### Week 1-2: Absorb Everything

Your first two weeks are not about proving how smart you are. They're about learning how things work.

**Do this:**
- Take extensive notes during onboarding sessions. I mean detailed notes. You won't remember everything, and asking the same question twice in your first month looks bad.
- Set up coffee chats with teammates. Not just engineers—talk to product managers, designers, QA, even operations folks. Understanding how your work fits into the bigger picture is crucial.
- Ask questions freely. This is the only time in your career when "I don't know" is not just acceptable but expected. Use it.
- Study the codebase. Don't just read the parts you'll work on—understand the architecture, the patterns, the conventions. Clone the repos, trace through key flows, run the debugger.

**Don't do this:**
- Push for major changes or criticize existing decisions. Even if you see obvious problems, wait. You don't have context yet.
- Volunteer for critical tasks. You're not ready, even if you think you are.
- Skip documentation because you think you'll remember. You won't.
- Stay isolated. Remote work makes this tempting, but isolation in your first weeks is career suicide.

**Indonesian Context:**
In many Indonesian companies, especially startups like Gojek or Tokopedia, there's a culture of "gotong royong"—working together collaboratively. Your first weeks are about integrating into this team dynamic. Don't be the lone wolf who codes in isolation. Join team lunches (virtual or physical), participate in team channels, and show that you're part of the community.

### Week 3-4: Start Contributing

By week three, you should begin making actual contributions. Start small—really small.

**Your first PR should be:**
- Low-risk (documentation, tests, minor bug fixes)
- Well-understood by the team
- Properly tested and reviewed
- Merged successfully

Why does this matter? Because your first successful contribution builds confidence—both yours and your team's confidence in you. It also teaches you the team's PR process, review standards, and quality expectations in a low-stakes environment.

I remember my first PR at Tokopedia. It was a simple bug fix—changing a validation rule that was too strict. I spent three hours on a change that took 10 lines of code. Why? Because I was learning the testing framework, the code review process, the deployment pipeline, and the team's communication norms. That three-hour investment paid dividends for the entire year.

### Month 2-3: Build Credibility

By month two, you should be taking on real tasks. This is where you start proving your value.

**Focus on:**
- Delivering consistently. Don't be the person with half-finished work. Ship complete, tested, documented features.
- Meeting deadlines. If you commit to having something done by Friday, have it done by Friday. If you can't, communicate early—never let deadlines silently slip.
- Code quality. Your code should be clean, tested, and maintainable. Don't ship hacks and plan to fix them later. Later never comes.
- Communication. Keep your team updated. Use daily standups effectively. Write clear PR descriptions. Respond to messages promptly.

**The Credibility Formula:**

Credibility = (Quality × Reliability) + Communication

Notice that being smart or being a fast coder isn't in this formula. Those things help, but they're not what builds trust. What builds trust is consistently delivering quality work, being reliable, and communicating effectively.

## Understanding Your Role Beyond Code

Here's something most new engineers miss: your job is not just to write code. Your job is to solve problems for your team and company.

Let me explain what I mean.

### You're Part of a Business

Whether you work at a startup or a corporation, you're part of a business that needs to generate value. As an engineer, you generate value by:
- Building features that users want
- Fixing issues that hurt users or the business
- Improving systems to make them faster, more reliable, or cheaper to operate
- Enabling other engineers to be more productive

The engineers who get promoted fastest are those who understand this and align their work accordingly.

**Example:**
At Bukalapak, I once spent a week optimizing a database query that was slowing down checkout. It wasn't glamorous work—just SQL optimization and caching. But it reduced checkout failures by 15%, which translated to millions in retained revenue. That work got noticed because it aligned with business goals.

### You're a Team Player

Software engineering is a team sport. Your success depends on your ability to work effectively with others.

**Being a good team player means:**
- Helping teammates when they're stuck, even if it's not your responsibility
- Writing code that others can understand and maintain
- Participating in code reviews thoughtfully and respectfully
- Sharing knowledge through documentation, tech talks, or mentoring
- Being positive and professional, even when things are frustrating

**What team players don't do:**
- Throw teammates under the bus when things go wrong
- Write clever code that only they can understand
- Hoard knowledge to make themselves indispensable
- Create drama or negativity in team channels
- Take credit for team achievements

In Indonesian work culture, being a team player is especially important. The concept of "menjaga nama baik" (maintaining good reputation) extends to your team and company. How you behave reflects on everyone around you.

## Building Relationships That Matter

Your technical skills got you hired. But your relationships will determine how far you go.

### Your Manager

Your relationship with your manager is the most important one in your first year.

**What great manager relationships look like:**
- Regular 1-on-1s where you discuss not just tasks but growth
- Clear understanding of expectations and how you're performing
- Open feedback (both ways)
- Trust and autonomy
- Support when you face challenges

**How to build this relationship:**
- Come to 1-on-1s prepared with updates, questions, and topics to discuss
- Ask for feedback explicitly: "What's one thing I could improve?"
- Be honest about struggles before they become crisis
- Follow through on commitments you make
- Show initiative but seek guidance on big decisions

**Red flags that need addressing:**
- You rarely talk to your manager
- You don't know how your manager evaluates your performance
- You feel like you can't be honest about challenges
- Feedback comes as a surprise

If you're experiencing these red flags, address them early. Request more frequent 1-on-1s. Ask direct questions about expectations. Don't wait for performance review season to discover you're not meeting expectations.

### Your Peers

Your fellow engineers are your daily support system. Invest in these relationships.

**Practical tips:**
- Pair program with different teammates. You'll learn their approaches and they'll learn yours.
- Be generous with code reviews. Don't just point out problems—explain why something matters and suggest solutions.
- Share interesting articles, tools, or techniques you discover.
- Celebrate others' wins. When a teammate ships something cool, acknowledge it publicly.
- Ask for help when stuck, but do your homework first.

I learned this the hard way. In my first role, I was so focused on proving myself that I worked in isolation. After six months, I realized I had no real relationships with my teammates. When I hit a major technical problem, I struggled alone because I hadn't built the social capital to ask for help comfortably. Don't make my mistake.

### Cross-functional Partners

Engineers don't work in vacuum. You'll interact with product managers, designers, QA, data analysts, and others. These relationships matter too.

**Build bridges by:**
- Understanding their constraints and challenges
- Communicating in their language (less jargon, more outcomes)
- Being responsive and collaborative
- Treating their work with respect (design isn't just "making it pretty," PM isn't just "writing tickets")

At Gojek, the most successful engineers I knew were those who built strong relationships with product and design. They got looped into decisions early, had influence over product direction, and got the most interesting projects because teams wanted to work with them.

## Learning the Technical Landscape

Your first year is about building technical competence, but that's more than just coding.

### Master the Stack

You need to deeply understand the technology stack your team uses.

**For backend engineers, this means:**
- The language and its idioms (don't write Java in Go or Python in JavaScript)
- The framework and its conventions
- The database(s) and data modeling patterns
- The deployment pipeline and infrastructure
- Monitoring, logging, and debugging tools
- Testing approaches and tools

**For frontend engineers:**
- The framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and its ecosystem
- State management patterns
- API integration approaches
- Browser APIs and capabilities
- Performance optimization techniques
- Accessibility standards

**For full-stack or mobile engineers:**
- All of the above, plus the integration points between systems

Don't try to learn everything at once. Pick one area at a time and go deep. Read official documentation. Build side projects using the stack. Study how senior engineers on your team solve problems.

### Understand the Domain

Technology alone isn't enough—you need to understand the business domain.

If you work at an e-commerce company, understand the checkout flow, inventory management, order fulfillment, and payment processing. If you work at a fintech, understand financial regulations, transaction processing, and risk management.

**How to build domain knowledge:**
- Use your company's product extensively. Be a power user.
- Read domain-specific resources (for fintech, read about payment systems; for e-commerce, learn about supply chain)
- Ask "why" questions. Why do we do it this way? What problems have we faced?
- Attend cross-functional meetings when possible
- Shadow customer support or sales teams

Domain knowledge is what separates good engineers from great ones. It's what allows you to propose solutions that actually work for the business, not just technically elegant solutions that miss the point.

### Learn the Codebase

This deserves special attention because it's something new engineers often struggle with.

**Strategies for learning a new codebase:**
- Start with the README and any onboarding documentation
- Identify the critical paths (e.g., user login, checkout flow, data processing pipeline)
- Use a debugger to trace through these paths. Don't just read the code—run it and see what happens.
- Make a small change and see what breaks. This reveals dependencies and architecture.
- Draw diagrams showing how components interact
- Ask senior engineers to explain the architecture in a whiteboard session

**Pro tip:** Create a personal wiki or note file documenting what you learn. Write down patterns you see, conventions the team follows, common gotchas, and useful commands. Future you will thank present you.

In Indonesian tech companies, codebases often carry legacy from rapid growth. Tokopedia and Gojek's codebases, for instance, have evolved significantly over years of hypergrowth. Understanding this history—why certain decisions were made—helps you navigate these systems more effectively.

## Common First-Year Pitfalls

Let me save you from the mistakes I see new engineers make repeatedly.

### Pitfall #1: The Perfectionist Trap

You spend weeks on a feature, polishing it to perfection, only to miss the deadline or discover the requirements changed. 

**Better approach:** Aim for "good enough for version 1." Ship something that works, gather feedback, then iterate. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.

### Pitfall #2: The Lone Wolf

You tackle problems alone because asking for help feels like admitting weakness.

**Reality check:** Senior engineers ask for help all the time. What they do differently is they do their homework first. Come with specific questions, show what you've tried, and respect people's time.

### Pitfall #3: The Imposter

You feel like everyone else knows what they're doing and you're just faking it.

**Truth:** Everyone feels this way sometimes. The difference between senior and junior engineers isn't that seniors don't have imposter syndrome—it's that they've learned to work through it. Focus on growth, not proving you're already perfect.

### Pitfall #4: The Yes-Person

You say yes to everything to prove your worth, then burn out or fail to deliver.

**Better approach:** Learn to say, "Let me check my current commitments and get back to you." It's better to deliver on fewer commitments than to over-promise and under-deliver.

### Pitfall #5: The Critic

You point out everything that's wrong with the codebase, processes, or decisions without understanding the context.

**Reality:** Every system has warts. They exist for reasons (often historical or resource constraints). Earn the right to criticize by first understanding why things are the way they are, and by proposing concrete solutions, not just complaints.

### Pitfall #6: The Ghost

You work remotely and disappear—minimal communication, late responses, unclear status updates.

**Impact:** In remote-first Indonesian companies like Xendit or Flip, communication is your lifeline. Overcommunicate rather than under-communicate. Make your work visible.

## Performance Reviews and Career Development

Most companies conduct formal performance reviews. Here's how to navigate them successfully.

### Before Your First Review

**Start documenting your work immediately:**
- Keep a "brag document" listing your accomplishments, impact, and learnings
- Save positive feedback from teammates, users, or managers
- Track metrics that show your impact (bugs fixed, features shipped, systems improved)
- Note challenges you overcame and what you learned

When review time comes, you'll have concrete evidence of your contributions instead of scrambling to remember what you did six months ago.

### Understanding Performance Criteria

Different companies evaluate performance differently, but most consider:

**Technical execution:**
- Code quality and best practices
- Delivery speed and reliability
- Technical growth and learning

**Collaboration:**
- Teamwork and communication
- Code review participation
- Knowledge sharing

**Impact:**
- Business value delivered
- Problem-solving effectiveness
- Initiative and ownership

**Indonesian context:**
Local companies often add cultural fit and "gotong royong" (collaborative spirit) as explicit evaluation criteria. Your ability to work harmoniously with the team matters as much as your technical chops.

### Setting Goals

Good goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

**Bad goal:** "Get better at backend development"

**Good goal:** "Complete the internal backend development course and ship three features using the new microservices architecture by Q3"

Work with your manager to set goals that:
- Align with team priorities
- Stretch you but remain achievable
- Include both technical and soft skills
- Have clear success criteria

### Handling Feedback

You will receive critical feedback. How you handle it determines your trajectory.

**When receiving feedback:**
- Listen without getting defensive
- Ask clarifying questions: "Can you give me a specific example?"
- Acknowledge the feedback: "I understand, thank you for letting me know"
- Create an action plan: "Here's what I'll do to improve"
- Follow up: Show you've addressed the feedback

**The growth mindset:** View feedback as data for improvement, not as personal attacks. The engineers who advance fastest are those who actively seek feedback and act on it.

## Building Your Technical Brand

Even in your first year, you're building a reputation. Make it count.

### Be Known for Something

What do you want to be known for? The person who writes great tests? The one who explains complex concepts clearly? The go-to for frontend performance?

Pick 1-2 things to be exceptional at. Being decent at everything but great at nothing makes you forgettable.

### Share Knowledge

**Ways to build your brand internally:**
- Give tech talks on topics you've learned
- Write documentation that helps others
- Answer questions in team channels
- Mentor interns or new joiners
- Contribute to internal tools and libraries

At Traveloka, I started giving monthly "learning lunches" where I'd share something I'd learned. It started small—just my immediate team. By year's end, engineers from other teams were attending. This visibility led to opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise.

### External Presence (Optional but Valuable)

Building an external presence takes time, but even in your first year you can start:
- Write blog posts about what you're learning
- Contribute to open source projects
- Speak at local meetups (Jakarta has great tech meetups)
- Engage with the Indonesian dev community on Twitter or LinkedIn

You don't need to be an expert to share. Teaching reinforces your own learning, and you'll be surprised how many people are at similar stages and appreciate your perspective.

## The Second Half of Your First Year

By month 6-7, you should feel comfortable. You know the codebase, understand the team dynamics, and have shipped real features. Now it's time to level up.

### Take on Bigger Challenges

Push your boundaries:
- Volunteer for more complex features
- Lead a small project from start to finish
- Mentor a new joiner or intern
- Participate in on-call rotations (if applicable)
- Contribute to technical design discussions

### Start Thinking About Your Second Year

Your first year sets the stage for your second. Start thinking about:
- What do you want to learn or accomplish in year two?
- What skills or experiences do you need to advance?
- Are you on track for the impact you want to make?
- What feedback do you need to address?

Have these discussions with your manager. The best managers will help you chart a path for growth. If your manager isn't supportive of your development, that's a signal about whether this is the right long-term fit for you.

## Navigating Challenges

Your first year won't be smooth sailing. Here's how to handle common challenges.

### When You're Stuck

**The 30-minute rule:** If you're stuck on something for more than 30 minutes, ask for help. Don't waste hours spinning your wheels.

**How to ask effectively:**
1. Describe what you're trying to do
2. Show what you've tried
3. Explain where you're stuck
4. Ask a specific question

**Example:** "I'm trying to implement user authentication using JWT. I've read the docs and implemented the token generation (here's my code), but the token verification is failing with error X. I've checked Y and Z, but I'm not sure how to debug further. Could you point me in the right direction?"

### When You Make a Mistake

You will make mistakes. You might break production, delete important data, or miss a critical deadline. It happens.

**When it does:**
1. Own it immediately. Don't hide or deflect.
2. Focus on fixing it, not explaining why it wasn't your fault.
3. Do a post-mortem: what happened, why, how to prevent it.
4. Learn and move forward. Don't dwell.

In Indonesian culture, saving face is important. But in engineering culture—local or global—owning mistakes builds more respect than covering them up. Companies like Gojek explicitly celebrate learning from failures through their blameless post-mortem culture.

### When You're Overwhelmed

First year can be overwhelming. New technology, new environment, high expectations—it's a lot.

**Strategies for managing overwhelm:**
- Break big tasks into small, manageable pieces
- Talk to your manager about workload—they can't help if they don't know
- Take actual breaks and time off. Burnout in your first year is not a badge of honor.
- Build a support network outside work (friends, family, mentors)
- Remember that struggling is normal and temporary

### When Company Culture Doesn't Fit

Sometimes you join a company and realize the culture isn't what you expected. Maybe it's too corporate, too chaotic, too political, or too aggressive.

**Give it time:** Culture shock is real. Give yourself at least 6-9 months before making judgments.

**Try to adapt:** Every culture has trade-offs. Can you find your niche within this culture?

**But be honest:** If after a year you genuinely hate coming to work, it might be time to consider moving on. Your first job doesn't have to be your last job. I'll talk more about when to move on in the next chapter.

## Work-Life Balance in Your First Year

Here's a controversial take: your first year is not the time to work strictly 40 hours and clock out.

**Wait, before you throw this book away, hear me out.**

I'm not advocating burnout or unhealthy overwork. What I'm saying is that your first year is an investment in your career. Putting in extra effort to learn faster, build relationships, and establish credibility pays dividends for years.

**What this might look like:**
- Spending evenings or weekends learning technologies you'll use
- Volunteering for projects that stretch you
- Reading technical books or documentation
- Building side projects to deepen your skills
- Attending tech meetups or workshops

**What this does NOT mean:**
- Working 80-hour weeks consistently
- Sacrificing your health or relationships
- Never taking time off
- Being available 24/7
- Burning yourself out

Find a sustainable pace that allows you to grow without destroying yourself. For me, this meant working normal hours during the week but dedicating Saturday mornings to learning and side projects. That extra 10-15 hours per week in my first year accelerated my growth tremendously.

**Indonesian context:** In Indonesian tech companies, especially startups during growth phases, the line between work and life can blur. Companies like Gojek during their rapid expansion expected high commitment. It's okay to work hard—just ensure it's sustainable and you're gaining valuable skills, not just spinning your wheels.

## Key Takeaways

Your first year is about more than surviving—it's about setting yourself up for a successful career.

**Remember:**

1. **The first 90 days set your reputation.** Start strong and consistent.

2. **Your job is to solve problems, not just write code.** Understand the business and domain.

3. **Relationships matter as much as technical skills.** Invest in your team, manager, and cross-functional partners.

4. **Master your stack and domain deeply.** Breadth matters, but depth makes you valuable.

5. **Avoid common pitfalls:** Don't be a perfectionist, lone wolf, or ghost. Ask for help, communicate well, and earn the right to criticize.

6. **Document everything.** Keep a brag doc for performance reviews.

7. **Handle feedback with grace.** Act on it and show growth.

8. **Build your brand.** Be known for something and share knowledge.

9. **Own your mistakes.** Fix them, learn from them, move on.

10. **Invest in growth, but sustainably.** Your first year is important, but not worth burning out over.

## Action Steps

Before moving on to the next chapter, do these:

**This week:**
- [ ] Schedule regular 1-on-1s with your manager if you don't already have them
- [ ] Set up coffee chats with 3 teammates you don't know well
- [ ] Start a "brag document" to track your accomplishments
- [ ] Identify one area of your stack to deep-dive into

**This month:**
- [ ] Complete and ship a small but meaningful contribution
- [ ] Ask your manager for specific feedback on one thing you can improve
- [ ] Document something you learned that will help the next new joiner
