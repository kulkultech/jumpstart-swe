# Chapter 8: The 2nd Year and Beyond

You survived your first year. Congratulations—that's a bigger deal than most people realize. You've built credibility, shipped features, learned the ropes, and established yourself as a contributing member of your team. But here's what nobody tells you: **the second year is where your real career begins**.

Your first year was about proving you belong. Your second year and beyond? That's about proving where you're going.

I've watched hundreds of engineers navigate this transition. Some accelerate dramatically, moving from junior to senior in 3-4 years. Others plateau, doing the same work year after year, wondering why promotions and opportunities pass them by. The difference isn't just talent or luck—it's understanding how to navigate the transition from junior to mid-level engineer, and eventually to senior roles.

Let me share what I've learned about making your second year (and the years beyond) count.

## The Transition: What Changes After Year One

After your first year, the expectations shift. You're no longer the new person who needs guidance on everything. People now expect you to:

**Own problems end-to-end**: Not just implement what you're told, but identify problems, propose solutions, and drive them to completion.

**Mentor others**: When the next batch of juniors joins, you're expected to help onboard and guide them.

**Make technical decisions**: Instead of always asking "how should I do this?", you're expected to evaluate options and recommend approaches.

**Think about the big picture**: Beyond your immediate tasks, understand how your work impacts the team, product, and business.

**Lead by influence**: Even without a formal leadership title, you should be influencing technical discussions and helping the team make better decisions.

If you're still operating like a first-year engineer in your second year, you're falling behind. The good news? Most engineers don't realize this, so making this shift gives you a massive advantage.

## Two Paths Emerge: Technical Depth vs. Leadership

Around your second or third year, you'll notice a fork in the road. Both paths are valuable, but they require different investments.

### The Technical Leadership Path

This path leads to roles like Senior Engineer, Staff Engineer, Principal Engineer, and eventually Distinguished Engineer or Technical Fellow. You become known for deep technical expertise and architectural thinking.

**What this looks like:**
- You're the go-to person for specific technical domains
- You design systems that others build
- You influence technical direction through expertise
- You solve the hardest technical problems on the team
- You mentor others on technical skills
- You may write less code but review more architecture

**Skills to develop:**
- System design and architecture
- Performance optimization
- Database design and scaling
- Infrastructure and DevOps
- Security and reliability
- Technical writing and documentation
- Teaching and mentoring

**Career progression:**
Junior → Mid-Level → Senior → Staff → Principal → Distinguished Engineer

**Who thrives here:** Engineers who love deep technical problems, prefer hands-on work, and want to remain individual contributors while still advancing.

### The Engineering Management Path

This path leads to roles like Tech Lead, Engineering Manager, Director, VP of Engineering, and eventually CTO. You become responsible for people, teams, and organizational outcomes.

**What this looks like:**
- You manage people and their performance
- You're responsible for team health and culture
- You make hiring and firing decisions
- You align technical work with business goals
- You handle cross-team coordination
- You still understand the technical work but delegate execution

**Skills to develop:**
- People management and coaching
- Communication and influence
- Project and program management
- Hiring and team building
- Stakeholder management
- Business acumen
- Conflict resolution

**Career progression:**
Junior → Mid-Level → Senior/Tech Lead → Engineering Manager → Senior EM → Director → VP → CTO

**Who thrives here:** Engineers who enjoy helping others grow, coordinating complex projects, and want direct responsibility for business outcomes.

### The Hybrid Path: Tech Lead

Many engineers don't want to choose between technical work and leadership. The Tech Lead role offers a middle ground—you lead projects and mentor people while still contributing code.

**What this looks like:**
- 50% coding, 50% coordination and leadership
- You drive project execution
- You mentor team members but don't formally manage them
- You make technical decisions for your team
- You're the bridge between management and engineers

**The challenge:** Tech Lead can be the hardest role because you're pulled in two directions. You need to ship code while also unblocking others, attending meetings, and planning work.

**Indonesian context:** At companies like Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka, Tech Lead is often the first leadership opportunity. It's a testing ground to see if you want to move into management or stay technical.

### How to Choose

You don't have to decide immediately. In fact, most people try both before committing. Here's my advice:

**Try tech lead responsibilities first**: Volunteer to lead a small project or mentor an intern. See how it feels.

**Pay attention to your energy**: Do you get energized by helping others succeed, or do you prefer solving technical problems alone? Both are valid.

**Consider your 10-year vision**: Where do you want to be? If you want to be CTO of a startup, you probably need management experience. If you want to be a recognized technical expert, stay on the IC track.

**Know that you can switch**: I've seen people move from management back to IC roles, and vice versa. It's not a one-way door.

**Remember the money question**: In Indonesia, management roles typically pay more at higher levels (Director+). But top IC roles (Staff+) at companies like Gojek or international companies can match or exceed management pay.

## The Mid-Level Engineer Toolkit

Whether you choose technical depth or leadership, certain skills become critical in your second year and beyond.

### 1. System Design Thinking

You need to start thinking in systems, not just features.

**What this means:**
- Understanding how components interact
- Considering scalability, reliability, and maintainability
- Making trade-offs between different approaches
- Designing for change and future requirements

**How to develop this:**
- Study system design patterns (read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann)
- Participate in architecture discussions, even as an observer
- Ask senior engineers to explain architectural decisions
- Design side projects with scale in mind
- Practice system design interviews (great learning even if you're not job hunting)

**Indonesian context:** As companies like Bukalapak and Tokopedia scale to millions of users, system design skills become invaluable. Understanding how to build for Indonesian internet infrastructure (varying connectivity, mobile-first users) is particularly valuable.

### 2. Code Quality and Best Practices

Your code should become a model for others.

**What great mid-level engineers do:**
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Add comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Consider edge cases and error handling thoroughly
- Leave code better than they found it (the Boy Scout rule)
- Write helpful PR descriptions and documentation

**The code review mindset shift:** In your first year, code reviews were about getting feedback. Now, code reviews are about teaching. When you review others' code, explain not just what to change, but why. This builds your influence and helps the team improve.

### 3. Project Management and Execution

Mid-level engineers don't just code—they deliver projects.

**This means:**
- Breaking large problems into manageable tasks
- Estimating work realistically (with buffers for unknowns)
- Communicating progress and blockers proactively
- Coordinating with other teams when needed
- Identifying risks early and raising them
- Driving projects to completion, not just implementation

**The difference:** Junior engineers execute tasks. Mid-level engineers own outcomes.

**Example from Gojek:** I worked with an engineer who was assigned to improve checkout success rates. A junior would have just fixed the bugs assigned to them. This mid-level engineer dug deeper, analyzed the data, identified that the issue was actually in the payment gateway integration, coordinated with the payments team, proposed a solution, drove the implementation across teams, and measured the impact. That's ownership.

### 4. Communication and Influence

Your technical skills got you here. Communication takes you further.

**Key communication skills:**

**Written communication:**
- Clear, concise technical documents
- Effective PR descriptions that explain context and decisions
- Helpful Slack/team channel messages
- Well-structured proposals for technical changes

**Verbal communication:**
- Explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- Running effective meetings (start on time, have an agenda, end with action items)
- Giving technical presentations
- Pair programming and live code reviews

**Influence without authority:**
- Proposing ideas in a way that makes others excited to support them
- Building consensus through data and reasoning, not just opinion
- Respecting others' perspectives while advocating for your view
- Knowing when to push and when to compromise

**Indonesian context:** In Indonesian workplace culture, "cara menyampaikan" (how you deliver your message) matters as much as the message itself. Being direct while remaining respectful is an art. Especially in more traditional corporate environments, understanding hierarchy and proper channels is important.

### 5. Domain Expertise

Become the expert in something valuable.

**Pick your specialty:**
- Performance optimization
- Security and authentication
- Data modeling and databases
- Frontend architecture and UX
- Backend APIs and microservices
- DevOps and infrastructure
- Testing and quality
- Specific business domains (payments, logistics, etc.)

**Why this matters:** When people think "we need someone who understands X," your name should come up. This makes you indispensable and increases your market value.

**How to build expertise:**
- Deep dive into the technology's official documentation
- Read the source code of tools you use
- Follow experts in the field
- Write blog posts explaining concepts
- Fix bugs and contribute to open source in that domain
- Give internal talks on the subject

**Pro tip:** Pick something your current company values highly. If you work at a fintech like Flip or Xendit, becoming a payments expert is more valuable than becoming a game development expert.

## Performance Reviews and Promotions

Let's talk about the thing everyone thinks about but few understand: how to actually get promoted.

### How Promotions Really Work

Here's the uncomfortable truth: promotions aren't just about doing good work. They're about:

1. **Doing work at the next level** (before you're promoted)
2. **Making your work visible** to decision-makers
3. **Having advocates** who push for you
4. **Timing and budget** (companies promote in cycles)

**The performance paradox:** Companies promote people who are already performing at the next level. You need to demonstrate senior engineer capabilities before getting the senior title. This feels unfair, but understanding it is crucial.

### The Brag Document Strategy

I mentioned this in Chapter 7, but it becomes even more critical now. Keep a detailed record of:

**Impact metrics:**
- Revenue generated or saved
- Performance improvements (reduced latency, increased throughput)
- User metrics (engagement, satisfaction, retention)
- Cost savings (infrastructure, process improvements)

**Projects delivered:**
- What you built, why it mattered, what the outcome was
- Your specific role and contributions
- Challenges overcome

**Leadership and influence:**
- Mentoring and helping others
- Technical decisions you drove
- Process improvements you initiated
- Cross-team collaboration

**Growth and learning:**
- New technologies mastered
- Certifications or courses completed
- Talks given or articles written

**Update this weekly.** When promotion time comes (or when you interview elsewhere), you'll have concrete evidence of your impact.

### The Promotion Conversation

Don't wait for your manager to bring up promotion. Be proactive.

**The right way to ask:**

"I'd like to discuss my career progression. I'm interested in growing toward [senior engineer/tech lead/etc.] in the next [6-12 months]. Based on your assessment, what gaps do I need to close to be ready for that level? What would success look like?"

**What you're doing here:**
- Showing ambition and intentionality
- Asking for specific feedback, not just "am I doing well?"
- Setting a timeline (creates urgency)
- Making it a two-way discussion, not a demand

**Follow up in writing:** After the conversation, send an email summarizing the discussion and the action items. This creates documentation and accountability.

### If You Don't Get Promoted

Sometimes you do everything right and still don't get promoted. Maybe budget constraints, maybe timing, maybe your manager dropped the ball. It happens.

**If you don't get promoted:**

1. **Ask for specific feedback**: "I'm disappointed but I want to understand. What specifically was missing?"

2. **Get a clear path forward**: "What do I need to demonstrate by the next review cycle to be ready?"

3. **Assess honestly**: Is this a temporary setback or a systemic issue with your company?

4. **Consider your options**: Sometimes the fastest path to senior engineer is a new company where you can negotiate the title.

**Red flags that suggest you should leave:**
- Your manager can't articulate what you need to do differently
- You've been "almost ready" for 2+ years
- Other engineers at your level got promoted but you didn't (with no clear explanation)
- The company has no defined promotion criteria

**Indonesian context:** At Indonesian startups experiencing rapid growth (like Gojek or Tokopedia in their hypergrowth phases), promotions can happen faster. At more traditional companies, promotion cycles are rigid. Know which environment you're in.

## When and How to Switch Companies

Here's a secret: the fastest way to increase your compensation and title is often to switch companies. Sad but true.

### Signs It's Time to Move On

**You should consider leaving if:**

**1. You've stopped learning**
- You're doing the same type of work repeatedly
- No challenging projects on the horizon
- No senior engineers to learn from

**2. You're underpaid**
- Your salary hasn't kept up with market rates
- New hires at your level are making more than you
- Raises are minimal (3-5% yearly doesn't keep up with skill growth)

**3. No growth path**
- No clear path to the next level
- Senior positions are blocked (people not leaving)
- Company isn't growing (fewer opportunities)

**4. Cultural misalignment**
- You fundamentally disagree with company direction or values
- Poor management you can't escape
- Toxic team dynamics that won't change

**5. Better opportunities exist**
- You've been approached by companies offering significantly better compensation or opportunities
- You want to work in a different domain or tech stack
- You want to work at a company at a different stage (startup vs. established)

**When NOT to leave:**
- Just because you had a bad week
- Before hitting at least 1 year (unless truly toxic)
- Without a clear idea of what you want next
- In the middle of a major project without proper handoff

### The 2-Year Rule

A general guideline: stay at least 2 years at each company, especially early in your career.

**Why this matters:**
- You need time to make real impact
- Job hopping every 6-12 months raises red flags for employers
- Deep learning takes time
- Your resume looks better with sustained contributions

**Exceptions:** If the company is truly toxic, about to fail, or you have an exceptional opportunity, it's okay to leave earlier. Just don't make it a pattern.

### How to Job Hunt While Employed

The best time to look for a job is when you have one. Here's how to do it ethically and effectively:

**1. Be discreet**
- Don't job hunt on company time or equipment
- Don't tell coworkers (word travels)
- Schedule interviews outside work hours or use PTO

**2. Be professional**
- Continue performing well at your current job
- Don't let your search affect your work quality
- Don't badmouth your company to recruiters

**3. Use your network**
- Reach out to contacts from past companies
- Attend tech meetups and conferences
- Engage with your LinkedIn network

**4. Time it right**
- Start looking 2-3 months before you want to move
- Consider company hiring cycles (January-March and September-October are busy)
- Keep multiple opportunities moving simultaneously for negotiation leverage

**5. Negotiate from strength**
- Being employed gives you negotiating power
- You can be patient and selective
- You can walk away from lowball offers

**Indonesian context:** The Indonesian tech market has become increasingly candidate-friendly, especially for mid-level engineers. Companies like Tokopedia, Shopee, and international companies with Indonesian offices compete aggressively for talent. Use this to your advantage.

### The Interview Process as a Mid-Level Engineer

Interviewing as a mid-level engineer is different from interviewing as a junior:

**What's expected now:**
- More complex system design questions
- Deeper technical knowledge
- Examples of leadership and ownership
- Understanding of trade-offs and architectural decisions
- Clear communication about past projects and impact

**Preparation differences:**
- Focus on medium-hard LeetCode problems, not just easy ones
- Study system design thoroughly (Grokking the System Design Interview, System Design Primer)
- Prepare detailed STAR stories about your projects
- Be ready to discuss technical decisions and trade-offs
- Research the company's technical stack and architecture

**The behavioral shift:** Juniors talk about what they learned. Mid-level engineers talk about what they delivered and how they did it.

## Salary Negotiation Revisited

You negotiated when you got your first job. Now you're negotiating with more experience and data points.

### Know Your Worth

Research thoroughly:
- Check Levels.fyi for your specific role and experience
- Look at Glassdoor and Blind for company-specific data
- Talk to recruiters about market rates
- Compare total compensation (base + bonus + equity + benefits)

**Indonesian salary context (2024 ballpark figures - always verify current rates):**
- Mid-level engineer (2-4 years) at top startups: Rp 20-40 juta/month
- Mid-level at international companies (remote): $30k-70k USD/year ($2.5k-6k/month)
- Mid-level at traditional corporations: Rp 15-30 juta/month
- Equity can add 20-50% to total compensation at startups

**Note:** Salary ranges change quickly. Always research current market rates using Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, local recruiters, and Indonesian tech communities. These figures are meant as rough guidelines, not definitive benchmarks.

**Remember:** Jakarta salaries are highest, but regional Indonesian cities are growing. Remote opportunities with international companies can 2-3x your earning potential.

### Negotiation Strategies at the Mid-Level

You have more leverage now:

**1. Competing offers:** If you have multiple offers, use them. "I have an offer from [Company] at [amount]. I prefer your opportunity because [reason], but the compensation difference is significant. Can you match or come closer?"

**2. Demonstrate value:** Show the impact you've had: "At my current company, I [specific achievement with metrics]. I'd bring that same approach to [specific problems at new company]."

**3. Negotiate the whole package:** Beyond base salary, negotiate:
- Signing bonus (can bridge gap without committing to higher salary)
- Equity grant or stock options
- Performance bonus percentage
- Level/title (sometimes easier to give than money)
- Remote work flexibility
- Learning budget

**4. Be willing to walk:** The best negotiating position is being willing to say no. If the offer doesn't meet your minimum acceptable threshold, decline respectfully.

**Pro tip:** Always negotiate. Companies expect it. I've never seen an offer rescinded because someone negotiated professionally.

## Building Influence and Technical Leadership

Even without a formal leadership title, you can (and should) build influence.

### How to Lead Without Authority

**1. Build credibility through consistency**
- Ship quality work reliably
- Follow through on commitments
- Be the person others can depend on

**2. Share knowledge generously**
- Write documentation that helps others
- Give internal tech talks
- Answer questions in team channels
- Mentor junior engineers

**3. Propose solutions, not just problems**
- "I noticed [problem]. I think we could solve it by [solution]. I'd be happy to drive this if others agree."
- Come with data and thought-through approaches
- Make it easy for others to say yes

**4. Build relationships across teams**
- Understand other teams' goals and constraints
- Help other teams when you can
- Become known as someone who makes collaboration easy

**5. Demonstrate good judgment**
- Know when to push for perfection vs. ship "good enough"
- Understand business context and priorities
- Make decisions that balance technical quality with practical constraints

**Example from Tokopedia:** One engineer I knew became incredibly influential despite being mid-level. How? She wrote exceptional documentation, always helped unblock others, and consistently delivered on commitments. When she proposed technical changes, people listened because she'd built credibility. Two years later, she was promoted to tech lead ahead of more senior engineers.

### The Power of Writing

Written communication compounds your influence:

**Internal writing:**
- Technical design documents
- Post-mortems and incident analyses
- Team wikis and knowledge bases
- RFC (Request for Comments) proposals

**External writing (builds your brand):**
- Technical blog posts
- Open source documentation
- Conference talk proposals
- Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)

**Why writing matters:**
- It scales your impact (one document reaches many people)
- It demonstrates clear thinking
- It creates a portfolio of your expertise
- It makes you discoverable (people find you through Google)

I've gotten job opportunities, speaking invitations, and consulting offers directly from technical blog posts I wrote years ago. Writing is a career accelerator.

## Long-Term Career Planning

Let's zoom out and think about your 5-10 year trajectory.

### The 5-Year Plan

Where do you want to be in 5 years? Here are common goals and the paths to reach them:

**Goal: Senior Engineer at a top company**
- Years 2-3: Build depth in technical domain, lead projects, mentor juniors
- Years 3-4: Senior-level responsibilities, system design ownership, cross-team influence
- Years 4-5: Apply for senior roles or get promoted internally

**Goal: Engineering Manager**
- Years 2-3: Tech lead experience, mentor multiple engineers, improve team processes
- Years 3-4: Formal management opportunity or move to company with management opening
- Years 4-5: Manage larger team, handle people responsibilities

**Goal: Join or start a startup**
- Years 2-3: Build broad skills, work on startup side projects, understand business
- Years 3-4: Join early-stage startup or start your own, take on multiple roles
- Years 4-5: Navigate growth challenges, potentially exit or continue scaling

**Goal: Work remotely for international company**
- Years 2-3: Build English skills, contribute to open source, build online presence
- Years 3-4: Apply for remote roles, get interview experience with international companies
- Years 4-5: Secure remote position, establish career working with global teams

**Goal: Technical specialist (Staff Engineer path)**
- Years 2-3: Deep expertise in specific domain, become the go-to expert
- Years 3-4: Influence architecture, mentor many engineers, solve hardest problems
- Years 4-5: Staff engineer role, recognized expert, impact beyond your team

**Indonesian context:** Many Indonesian engineers now follow hybrid paths—working remotely for international companies while living in Indonesia, or doing consulting while building their own startups. The tech ecosystem here offers flexibility that previous generations didn't have.

### Continuous Learning Strategy

Technology changes fast. Your learning needs to keep pace.

**Build a learning system:**

**Daily learning (15-30 minutes):**
- Read technical blogs and newsletters
- Follow key people in your domain on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Review interesting code on GitHub

**Weekly learning (2-4 hours):**
- Complete online course modules
- Work on side projects
- Read technical books (aim for 1-2 books per quarter)
- Practice algorithms or system design

**Monthly learning:**
- Attend meetups or conferences
- Write a blog post or documentation
- Try a new technology or tool
- Reflect on what you learned at work

**Quarterly learning:**
- Take a course or certification
- Attend a conference
- Do a small project with new tech stack
- Review and adjust your learning plan

**Resources for continuous learning:**
- Online platforms: Coursera, Udemy, Frontend Masters, Egghead
- Books: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications," "Clean Code," "The Pragmatic Programmer"
- System design: System Design Primer (GitHub), Grokking the System Design Interview
- Stay current: HackerNews, dev.to
- Indonesian tech communities: 
  - Tech in Asia (techinasia.com) - news and insights about Southeast Asian tech
  - Indonesian Slack communities (search "developer Indonesia" or "tech Indonesia" on various platforms)
  - Jakarta meetup groups on Meetup.com (search "Jakarta tech," "Jakarta JavaScript," etc.)
  - LinkedIn groups for Indonesian developers
  - Local conference communities (DevFest Jakarta, TechTalks)

### Building Your Personal Brand

Your personal brand becomes increasingly important:

**Your online presence should include:**

**LinkedIn:**
- Updated profile with detailed experience
- Regular posts about your learnings
- Engage with Indonesian tech community

**GitHub:**
- Active contributions to projects
- Well-documented repositories
- Consistent commit history

**Optional but valuable:**
- Personal blog or Medium
- Technical Twitter/X account
- Stack Overflow contributions
- Conference talks or meetup presentations

**Why this matters:** Your personal brand works for you 24/7. Recruiters search for engineers by skills. Hiring managers Google candidates. Your online presence is your extended resume.

**I've seen engineers land amazing opportunities because:**
- A recruiter found their blog post
- Their GitHub showed strong open source work
- They spoke at a meetup that a hiring manager attended
- Their LinkedIn posts demonstrated expertise

## Health, Balance, and Sustainability

Here's something nobody tells you: career success means nothing if you burn out or sacrifice everything else.

### Sustainable Performance

The engineers with the longest, most successful careers don't work 80-hour weeks for years. They find sustainable rhythms:

**Work smart, not just hard:**
- Focus on high-impact work
- Learn to say no to low-value tasks
- Automate repetitive work
- Take breaks to maintain creativity
- Protect deep work time

**Invest in yourself outside work:**
- Exercise regularly (seriously, this matters)
- Maintain relationships with friends and family
- Have hobbies unrelated to coding
- Get adequate sleep (sleep-deprived engineers make expensive mistakes)
- Take real vacations (not "workcations")

**Signs of burnout to watch for:**
- Chronic exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix
- Cynicism about your work
- Reduced productivity despite working more
- Physical symptoms (headaches, stomach issues)
- Loss of enthusiasm for things you used to enjoy

**If you're burning out:** Talk to your manager, take time off, consider whether your current role is sustainable. Burnout can take months or years to recover from. Prevention is crucial.

**Indonesian context:** Work-life balance in Indonesian startups can be challenging, especially during growth phases. Set boundaries early. "Kerja keras" (working hard) is valued, but "kerja cerdas" (working smart) is better. Companies increasingly recognize that burnt-out engineers produce poor work.

### Financial Planning

Your second year and beyond is when you should get serious about finances:

**Build an emergency fund:** 6-12 months of expenses. This gives you freedom to take career risks or leave bad situations.

**Invest for the future:** Don't let money sit in low-interest savings. Consider:
- Stock market (index funds are simple and effective)
- Property (if you plan to stay in one location)
- Retirement accounts (if your company offers them)

**Understand your equity:** If you have stock options or equity:
- Know your vesting schedule
- Understand the tax implications
- Don't assume equity will be worth millions (but don't ignore it)
- Consider equity value when evaluating job offers

**Increase your income strategically:**
- Primary job salary increases (promotions, job switches)
- Side consulting or freelance (if your contract allows)
- Technical writing or courses (passive income)
- Speaking at conferences (can lead to opportunities)

**Indonesian financial context:** Cost of living in Indonesia is lower than Western countries, giving you more flexibility. Many Indonesian engineers use geographic arbitrage—working remotely for international companies while living in Indonesia—to build wealth faster.

## Common Second-Year Mistakes

Let me save you from pitfalls I've seen repeatedly:

### Mistake #1: Staying Too Comfortable

You're finally comfortable in your role. You know the codebase, the people, the processes. This is dangerous.

**The problem:** Comfort leads to stagnation. You stop pushing boundaries, stop learning, stop growing.

**The fix:** Intentionally seek discomfort. Volunteer for projects outside your expertise. Work with unfamiliar technologies. Join a different team. Push yourself.

### Mistake #2: Focusing Only on Technical Skills

You keep grinding LeetCode and learning new frameworks, but you neglect communication, leadership, and business understanding.

**The problem:** At mid-level and beyond, technical skills are table stakes. What differentiates you is leadership and business impact.

**The fix:** Spend time on soft skills. Practice presentations. Learn about your company's business model. Understand what makes your product successful.

### Mistake #3: Not Building Relationships

You stay in your bubble—your team, your focus area, your projects.

**The problem:** Opportunities come through relationships. The people who advance fastest have strong networks.

**The fix:** Invest in relationships. Have coffee chats with engineers on other teams. Attend company events. Help others when you can. Build genuine connections.

### Mistake #4: Waiting for Permission

You wait for someone to tell you you're ready for bigger responsibilities.

**The problem:** Nobody's managing your career but you. Waiting for opportunities means missing them.

**The fix:** Take initiative. Propose projects. Ask for challenging work. Make your ambitions known. Create opportunities instead of waiting for them.

### Mistake #5: Comparing Yourself to Others

You see peers getting promoted or joining fancy companies and feel like you're behind.

**The problem:** Everyone's on their own timeline. Comparison leads to poor decisions (taking the wrong job because of title or prestige).

**The fix:** Focus on your own trajectory. Are you growing? Learning? Building toward your goals? That's what matters.

### Mistake #6: Neglecting Your Personal Life

You sacrifice relationships, health, and happiness for career advancement.

**The problem:** Career success without personal happiness is hollow. And burnout derails careers.

**The fix:** Integrate work and life. Set boundaries. Invest in relationships. Take care of your health. Success should enhance your life, not consume it.

## Real Stories: Engineers Who Navigated This Well

**Rina's Journey (Technical Depth):**
Rina joined Tokopedia as a backend engineer. In her second year, she became obsessed with database performance. She read books, took courses, optimized critical queries, and gave internal talks on database design. By year three, she was the database expert everyone consulted. Year four, she was promoted to Senior Engineer and led the database architecture team. Year five, she moved to a Staff Engineer role with a 60% salary increase. She found her niche and went deep.

**Budi's Path (Management):**
Budi started at Gojek as a mobile engineer. Year two, he became an informal tech lead, helping coordinate the team's work and mentoring two junior engineers. Year three, he took a formal Tech Lead role. Year four, his manager left and he stepped up as interim Engineering Manager. He loved it. Year five, he was promoted to Engineering Manager officially, managing 8 engineers. Now he's leading a 20-person team.

**Sari's Pivot (Career Change):**
Sari spent three years at a traditional bank as a backend engineer. She was bored and underpaid. Year four, she aggressively upskilled in system design and interviewing. She applied to 20 companies, got offers from three, and negotiated hard. She joined Shopee as a Senior Engineer with a 70% salary increase and much more interesting work. Sometimes the fastest growth comes from leaving.

**My Own Second Year:**
In my second year, I made a deliberate choice to focus on becoming a domain expert in real-time systems. I volunteered for every project touching real-time features, read extensively about WebSockets and event-driven architecture, and built side projects to experiment. By year three, when a critical real-time feature needed to be built, I was the obvious choice to lead it. That project's success led to my promotion to Senior Engineer and opened doors I couldn't have imagined.

## Key Takeaways

Your second year and beyond is where your career really takes shape.

**Remember:**

1. **The expectations shift after year one.** You're expected to own problems, mentor others, and think bigger.

2. **Two paths emerge: technical depth and management.** Both are valuable. Choose based on what energizes you, but don't stress—you can switch paths later.

3. **Mid-level engineers need more than coding skills.** System design, communication, project ownership, and influence become critical.

4. **Promotions require demonstrating next-level work before the promotion.** Document your impact and be proactive about career conversations.

5. **Job switching is often the fastest path to salary and title increases.** Stay at least 2 years, but don't stay out of inertia.

6. **Build influence through consistent delivery, knowledge sharing, and helping others.** Leadership isn't just a title.

Your second year and beyond isn't just about surviving—it's about thriving and building toward the career you want. Every year should take you closer to your goals, whether that's technical mastery, leadership, entrepreneurship, or something else entirely.

The engineers who succeed long-term aren't necessarily the smartest or most talented. They're the ones who are intentional about their growth, resilient in the face of setbacks, and strategic about their careers.

You've built your foundation in year one. Now it's time to build something remarkable on top of it. Go make it happen.
