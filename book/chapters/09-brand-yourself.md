# Chapter 9: Brand Yourself

Here's something most career advice won't tell you: your technical skills might get you in the door, but your personal brand determines how far and how fast you'll go. I've seen brilliant engineers stuck in the same role for years, while others with similar skills accelerate their careers simply because people know who they are and what they're capable of.

When I was early in my career, I thought my code would speak for itself. I was wrong. The engineers who got promoted, who got interesting projects, who got recruited by top companies—they weren't necessarily the best coders. They were the ones people knew about.

This chapter isn't about becoming an influencer or building a fake persona. It's about strategically making your work and expertise visible to the people who matter. Whether you're in Jakarta, Bandung, or working remotely for a global company, building your professional brand is one of the highest-leverage activities you can invest in.

## What Is a Professional Brand (And What It Isn't)

Your professional brand is the reputation you build around your expertise and how you show up in the industry. It's what people say about you when you're not in the room. It's what comes up when someone Googles your name or checks your LinkedIn.

**Your brand is not:**
- A fake persona or playing someone you're not
- Being active on social media 24/7
- Becoming an "influencer" with thousands of followers
- Bragging about your achievements
- Marketing yourself as something you're not

**Your brand is:**
- The authentic presentation of your skills and expertise
- Your professional reputation and credibility
- The value you provide to your community
- Your visibility in your field
- The relationships and networks you build

In Indonesia's competitive tech market, having a strong brand can be the difference between waiting months for a job response and having companies reach out to you directly.

## Why Branding Matters (Especially in Indonesia)

The Indonesian tech scene is unique. Jakarta, Bandung, and other tech hubs have thousands of engineers competing for top positions at companies like Gojek, Tokopedia, Traveloka, and Bukalapak. International companies are also setting up engineering teams here, but they're selective.

**From an employer's perspective (the HR angle):**

When I've been involved in hiring, here's the reality: we get hundreds of applications for a single role. Most resumes look similar—same universities, similar skills, comparable experience. So how do we decide who to interview?

We look for people we've heard of. Someone who gave a talk at a meetup. Someone whose blog post helped us solve a problem. Someone who contributed to an open-source project we use. Someone a teammate knows and recommends. These people skip to the front of the line.

**From a career growth perspective:**

The best opportunities often don't get posted on job boards. They're filled through networks. That senior role at that exciting startup? They're asking their network first. That interesting project at work? It goes to someone the manager knows and trusts. That speaking slot at a conference? They invite people they know are good.

Your brand opens doors you didn't even know existed.

## The Components of Your Professional Brand

Let's break down the practical elements of building your brand. You don't need to do everything—pick what aligns with your personality and goals.

### 1. Online Presence: Your Digital Footprint

Your online presence is often the first impression people have of you. In 2024, if you're not findable online, you barely exist professionally.

#### GitHub: Show Your Code

Your GitHub is your portfolio as a developer. It's proof of what you can actually do.

**What to do:**
- **Pin your best projects** - Choose 3-4 projects that showcase different skills
- **Write good READMEs** - Explain what the project does, why it matters, how to run it. A project with a great README looks 10x more professional
- **Contribute to open source** - Even small contributions show you can work with existing codebases and collaborate
- **Keep consistent activity** - You don't need to code every day, but regular commits show you're active
- **Clean up old projects** - Archive or delete half-finished projects that don't represent your current skills

**Pro tip for Indonesian developers:** Contributing to international open-source projects helps you build credibility beyond Indonesia. It shows you can work in English and collaborate with global teams.

I've hired engineers specifically because I saw their thoughtful contributions on GitHub. One candidate fixed a bug in a library we were using. When I saw their name in the contributors list, they immediately became more interesting.

#### LinkedIn: Your Professional Hub

In Indonesia, LinkedIn is where professional opportunities happen. Tech recruiters and hiring managers actively search LinkedIn for candidates.

**Make your LinkedIn work for you:**
- **Professional photo** - A clear, professional headshot. No selfies, no group photos
- **Headline that pops** - Not just "Software Engineer at XYZ." Try "Backend Engineer | Building scalable systems | Python & Go enthusiast"
- **Detailed experience** - Don't just list job duties. Highlight achievements: "Reduced API response time by 60%" not "Worked on backend APIs"
- **Skills section** - List relevant technical skills. Colleagues can endorse them, adding credibility
- **Custom URL** - linkedin.com/in/yourname looks cleaner than the default string of numbers
- **Active engagement** - Share articles, comment on posts, celebrate team wins

**What actually matters on LinkedIn:**
- When recruiters search for "Python engineer Jakarta," will you show up?
- When someone checks your profile, does it clearly communicate your value?
- Does your network include people at companies you're interested in?

**The Indonesian angle:** Many Indonesian tech companies rely heavily on LinkedIn for recruiting. Being visible and active on LinkedIn significantly increases your chances of being approached with opportunities.

#### Personal Website/Blog: Your Platform

A personal website or blog establishes you as someone who thinks deeply about their craft. It doesn't need to be fancy—a simple blog works fine.

**What to write about:**
- **Technical deep dives** - "How I optimized our database queries"
- **Lessons learned** - "What I learned building my first microservice"
- **Tool reviews** - "My experience switching from REST to GraphQL"
- **Career insights** - "How I landed my first remote job"
- **Tutorials** - "Getting started with Docker in 30 minutes"

**Why writing matters:**
- It forces you to understand topics deeply. If you can explain it, you understand it
- It showcases your expertise to potential employers
- It helps others, building goodwill in the community
- It's SEO - when people Google technical problems, your solutions might come up
- It demonstrates communication skills, which employers value

You don't need to write every week. One thoughtful post per month is enough. Quality over quantity.

I got my first remote job partially because the CTO found my blog post about solving a specific technical problem. That one article opened a door.

#### Twitter/X (Tech Twitter): Join the Conversation

Tech Twitter is where developers share ideas, ask questions, and network. It's less formal than LinkedIn but professionally valuable.

**How to use Twitter effectively:**
- **Follow interesting people** - Other developers, tech leaders, companies you admire
- **Share what you're learning** - "TIL (Today I Learned) that Python's `asyncio` handles concurrency differently than threading"
- **Ask questions** - The tech community loves helping
- **Share your work** - Blog posts, projects, achievements
- **Engage genuinely** - Reply to posts, join discussions, add value

**You don't need thousands of followers.** Having 200 engaged followers in the tech community is more valuable than 10,000 random followers.

**The engagement formula:** Share knowledge + ask questions + celebrate others + show your work = growing presence

### 2. Speaking: Share Your Knowledge

Public speaking is one of the fastest ways to build your brand. When you speak at a meetup or conference, you're positioning yourself as an expert.

#### Start Local and Small

You don't need to speak at international conferences right away. Start with:

- **Company tech talks** - Internal presentations at your workplace
- **Local meetups** - Tech meetups in your city (Jakarta has dozens)
- **University guest lectures** - Your alma mater would likely welcome you
- **Online webinars** - Lower pressure than in-person talks
- **Lightning talks** - 5-10 minute quick presentations at meetups

**Indonesian tech communities to explore:**
- JakartaJS, PHPid, Python Indonesia, Android/iOS meetups
- Facebook Developer Circle Jakarta
- Google Developer Group (GDG) chapters
- DevDiscuss Indonesia
- Various Slack and Discord communities

#### Choosing Topics

You don't need to be a world expert to give a talk. You just need to know more than most of your audience about a specific topic.

**Good topics for beginners:**
- Something you struggled with and figured out
- A tool or technology you recently learned
- A bug that took you days to fix
- A design pattern you found useful
- Your experience at your internship/first job

**Formula for a good tech talk:**
1. The problem or challenge
2. How you approached it
3. What you learned
4. Key takeaways for the audience

**From an HR perspective:** When we hire, especially for senior roles, we look for people who can mentor and share knowledge. Speaking experience signals that you can communicate complex ideas and are comfortable in leadership situations.

#### Dealing with Fear

I was terrified of my first tech talk. My hands shook, my voice cracked, and I rushed through slides. But I did it. The second talk was easier. By the fifth talk, I actually enjoyed it.

**Tips for nervous speakers:**
- **Start with a topic you know deeply** - Confidence comes from knowledge
- **Practice out loud** - Multiple times, alone
- **Record yourself** - Awkward but helpful for improvement
- **Join Toastmasters** - Great for building speaking skills
- **Remember everyone wants you to succeed** - Audiences are supportive

Every experienced speaker started as a beginner. The only difference is they kept going.

### 3. Writing: Document Your Journey

We touched on blogging, but let's go deeper. Writing is one of the highest-leverage activities for brand building.

#### Where to Write

**Your own blog:**
- Full control
- Own your content
- Build SEO for your name
- Professional look

**Dev.to or Medium:**
- Built-in audience
- Easy to start
- Good discoverability
- Active tech community

**LinkedIn articles:**
- Reaches your professional network
- Good for career-focused content
- Higher visibility in Indonesia

**Why not all three?** Publish on your blog, then cross-post to Dev.to and Medium with a canonical link. Maximum reach, no downsides.

#### Writing Consistently

You don't need to be a daily writer. Most successful technical bloggers publish 1-2 times per month.

**Content ideas:**
- Document what you're learning
- Write the tutorial you wish existed
- Share your mistakes and lessons
- Review tools and technologies
- Analyze interesting code or systems
- Opinion pieces on tech trends

**The best time to write about something is right after you learn it.** You remember the pain points and confusion that experts forget. Your explanations will resonate with others learning the same thing.

**Pro tip:** Create a "writing ideas" note on your phone. Whenever you solve an interesting problem or learn something valuable, jot it down. You'll never run out of topics.

### 4. Open Source: Build in Public

Contributing to open source is like having thousands of people review your resume. Your GitHub contributions are public proof of your skills.

#### How to Start

**For beginners:**
- Fix documentation typos (seriously, this counts)
- Improve README files
- Add examples to docs
- Fix small bugs labeled "good first issue"
- Write tests

**As you grow:**
- Fix bugs
- Add features
- Review pull requests
- Help with issues and discussions
- Maintain projects

**Finding projects to contribute to:**
- Tools you use daily
- Projects from companies you admire
- "Good first issue" labels on GitHub
- Projects in languages you want to learn

**The Indonesian angle:** Many Indonesian engineers contribute to local open-source projects (e.g., frameworks or tools popular in the Indonesian developer community). This builds your reputation locally while developing skills.

#### Creating Your Own Projects

You don't need to build the next big framework. Small, useful projects work great:

- A tool that solves a problem you had
- A wrapper around an API you use
- A simple game or app
- A useful bot (Telegram bot, Discord bot)
- A starter template for your favorite stack

**The key is documentation.** A simple project with excellent documentation is more impressive than a complex project nobody can understand.

### 5. Networking: Building Genuine Relationships

Your network is your net worth, as the saying goes. But networking isn't about collecting business cards or LinkedIn connections. It's about building genuine relationships.

#### Where to Network in Indonesia

**Online:**
- Slack communities (many Indonesian tech companies have public Slacks)
- Discord servers (programming, specific technologies)
- Telegram groups (very popular in Indonesia)
- LinkedIn groups and conversations
- Twitter/X spaces

**Offline:**
- Tech meetups in your city
- Hackathons
- Conferences (Java Developer Day, DevFest, Tech in Asia)
- Company-hosted events
- University tech clubs and events

**The coffee chat strategy:** When you admire someone's work, reach out and ask for a 30-minute coffee chat (virtual or in-person). Most people are happy to help. Ask thoughtful questions, be genuinely curious, and follow up with value (share an article, make an introduction, whatever you can offer).

#### Networking That Doesn't Feel Gross

If "networking" feels uncomfortable, think of it as "making friends in tech." Be genuinely interested in people. Help others. Share knowledge. Celebrate their wins. Over time, you build a community.

**The give-first mentality:** Don't network with the mindset of "what can I get?" Ask "how can I help?" Share job postings, introduce people, promote others' work, offer feedback. Good karma returns.

**From HR perspective:** When we need to fill a position, we ask the team "do you know anyone good?" Your network determines whether your name comes up in these conversations.

### 6. Mentoring and Teaching

Teaching others is one of the best ways to solidify your brand as an expert. It also feels good—helping others grow is incredibly rewarding.

**Ways to mentor:**
- Offer to mentor junior engineers at work
- Answer questions on Stack Overflow
- Help beginners in online communities
- Create tutorial videos (YouTube, others)
- Pair program with less experienced developers
- Review code and provide thoughtful feedback

**The learning pyramid:** You retain 90% of what you teach. When you explain concepts to others, you understand them more deeply. Mentoring makes you better at your craft.

**In Indonesian context:** Many developers are eager to learn but lack access to mentorship. By helping others, you're also building a reputation as someone approachable and knowledgeable.

## The Brand-Building Framework: Your 6-Month Plan

Building a brand takes time. Here's a realistic 6-month plan you can follow.

### Month 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Clean up your LinkedIn profile (professional photo, detailed experience)
- [ ] Update your GitHub (pin best projects, improve READMEs, archive old junk)
- [ ] Set up a simple personal website or blog (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Identify 3-5 online communities to join
- [ ] Start following interesting people on Twitter
- [ ] Write your first blog post or technical article

### Month 3-4: Consistency
- [ ] Publish at least 2 more blog posts
- [ ] Make 5-10 contributions to open source (can be small)
- [ ] Attend 2-3 local tech meetups
- [ ] Be active in online communities (answer questions, share insights)
- [ ] Share your work and learning on social media
- [ ] Reach out to 2-3 people for coffee chats

### Month 5-6: Visibility
- [ ] Submit a talk proposal to a local meetup
- [ ] Write 2 more blog posts
- [ ] Continue open source contributions
- [ ] Help a junior developer or mentee
- [ ] Engage more deeply in your chosen communities
- [ ] Start building relationships with people at companies you're interested in

**After 6 months:** You should have a solid online presence, some published content, contributions to open source, and growing connections in the tech community. You're no longer invisible.

## What Works in the Indonesian Context

Indonesia's tech scene has unique dynamics. Here's what matters specifically here:

### Language Considerations

**English proficiency is a signal.** Writing blog posts in English, contributing to international open source, and speaking English at meetups signals that you can work with global teams. Many top Indonesian tech companies work with international partners or have global ambitions.

**But Indonesian matters too.** Content in Bahasa Indonesia reaches a huge, underserved audience. Many Indonesian developers prefer learning in their native language. Creating content in Indonesian can build a strong local following.

**The best approach?** Do both. Write some content in English (shows global capability) and some in Indonesian (connects with local community).

### The Jakarta Effect

Jakarta is the tech hub of Indonesia. Most major tech companies, startups, and events are here. If you're not in Jakarta:

- **Travel for key events** - Annual conferences and major meetups
- **Be active online** - You can network remotely
- **Build local communities** - Start meetups in your city
- **Remote opportunities** - Many Jakarta companies hire remotely now

If you're in Jakarta, take full advantage. Attend meetups regularly. The tech community is smaller than you think—you'll start seeing familiar faces, and doors will open.

### Company Reputation Matters

Working at known companies (Gojek, Tokopedia, Traveloka, Shopee, Grab) gives your brand an automatic boost. The company's reputation transfers to you.

But you can also build your brand at a lesser-known company by being visible. I know engineers at small startups who are more well-known than engineers at big tech companies, simply because they blog, speak, and contribute to open source.

### Remote Work and Global Brands

Post-pandemic, many Indonesian engineers work remotely for international companies. This is great for income but can hurt your local brand if you're not careful.

**Stay connected locally:**
- Still attend Jakarta/Indonesian tech events when possible
- Engage in Indonesian tech communities
- Mentor local developers
- Share your remote work experience (content gold!)

Your global experience makes you more valuable in the Indonesian market, but only if people know about it.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

I've seen engineers make these mistakes when building their brand:

### 1. Being Inauthentic

Don't pretend to be an expert in things you're not. Share what you're learning, not just what you've mastered. Authenticity builds trust; fake expertise destroys it.

### 2. Only Taking, Never Giving

Don't just promote yourself. Share others' work, celebrate teammates, help beginners, contribute to communities. The best brand-builders are generous with knowledge.

### 3. Being Inconsistent

Posting 10 articles in a month then disappearing for 6 months doesn't work. Slow and steady wins. One post a month for a year beats 12 posts in January and silence after.

### 4. Focusing on Vanity Metrics

Don't obsess over follower counts or likes. Focus on genuine connections and valuable content. 100 engaged readers are better than 10,000 passive followers.

### 5. Neglecting Quality

A rush of low-quality content hurts your brand. Better to publish one excellent article than five mediocre ones. Your name is attached to everything you put out.

### 6. Being Negative or Controversial for Attention

Hot takes and drama might get attention short-term but damage your reputation long-term. Be thoughtful, respectful, and constructive. Even when you disagree with something, express it professionally.

### 7. Forgetting That Everything is Public

That sarcastic tweet? Your future employer will see it. That LinkedIn post complaining about your company? It's there forever. Assume everything you post is visible to everyone, including future employers.

## The Long-Term Game

Building a brand isn't a 3-month sprint. It's a long-term investment in your career. The blog post you write today might help you land a job two years from now. The talk you give next month might lead to an opportunity you can't imagine yet.

I've been building my brand for over a decade. That early blog post? Still gets traffic and leads to opportunities. Those first awkward talks? They led to speaking at bigger venues and eventually consulting opportunities. The junior engineer I mentored? They referred me to their company later.

**The compound effect is real:** Small consistent actions compound over time. Your reputation grows. Your network expands. Opportunities multiply.

## When Brand Building Pays Off

Here are real scenarios where your brand makes a tangible difference:

**Job searching:**
- Instead of sending 50 cold applications, companies reach out to you
- When you do apply, your name is recognized
- Internal referrals come more easily
- You can be more selective about opportunities

**Career progression:**
- You get tapped for interesting projects
- Management sees you as a future leader
- Promotions come more easily
- You have more negotiating power

**Side opportunities:**
- Speaking gigs (often paid)
- Consulting and freelance opportunities
- Technical writing or content creation
- Advisory roles at startups

**Network effects:**
- Easier to find co-founders for your startup
- Better access to mentors and advisors
- Invitations to exclusive events or communities
- Job opportunities through your network

**Personal satisfaction:**
- Helping others through your content
- Being recognized for your expertise
- Building lasting relationships
- Creating a body of work you're proud of

## Taking Action: Start Today

Brand building feels overwhelming when you look at the whole picture. So don't. Start with one small action today.

**Pick one:**
- Update your LinkedIn headline and about section
- Write a 500-word blog post about something you learned this week
- Clean up your GitHub and pin your best project
- Join one tech community online
- Reach out to someone for a coffee chat
- Submit your first open-source contribution
- Sign up to give a lightning talk at a meetup

Just one. Then tomorrow, do one more thing. In six months, you'll be amazed at your progress.

## Remember: Your Brand is About Value

The best professional brands aren't built on self-promotion. They're built on providing value. When you help others, share knowledge, contribute to projects, and participate in communities, your brand builds itself.

Focus on:
- **Learning in public** - Share your journey
- **Helping others** - Be generous with knowledge
- **Doing good work** - Let quality speak
- **Being consistent** - Show up regularly
- **Staying authentic** - Be genuinely you

Do these things, and opportunities will find you. That's the power of a strong professional brand.

Your career is long. Start building your brand now, and future you will be grateful. In Indonesia's competitive tech market, being good isn't enough. People need to know you're good. Make yourself visible. Share your work. Build your brand.

Your code might speak for itself, but your brand speaks even louder.
