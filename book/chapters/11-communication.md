# Chapter 11: Master the Art of Communication

Let me tell you about the biggest career mistake I made early on. I was a junior engineer at a growing startup, and I'd just fixed a critical bug that had been plaguing our production system for weeks. I was proud—really proud. Senior engineers had tried and failed. I'd cracked it in two days.

So I submitted my pull request with the description: "Fixed the bug."

That's it. Four words. No explanation of what was wrong, how I fixed it, or why my approach worked. When my tech lead asked me to explain it in a code review, I got defensive. "The code speaks for itself," I said, thinking I was being professional.

I wasn't being professional. I was being a terrible communicator. And it almost cost me my job.

My tech lead pulled me aside: "You're a good engineer. But if you can't communicate what you're doing, you'll never be a great one. And you definitely won't be a senior engineer."

That conversation changed my career. I realized that being a software engineer is not just about writing code—it's about communicating ideas, explaining decisions, collaborating with teams, and building consensus. The best engineers I know aren't necessarily the best coders. They're the best communicators who happen to code well.

## Why Communication Skills Are Your Superpower

Here's something they don't tell you in computer science classes: past a certain technical threshold, your career growth is determined more by your communication skills than your coding ability.

Think about it:
- You need to explain your design decisions to your team
- You need to write documentation that others can understand
- You need to present technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- You need to give and receive feedback in code reviews
- You need to negotiate priorities with product managers
- You need to mentor junior engineers
- You need to advocate for technical improvements
- You need to coordinate with teams across different time zones

Every single one of these requires strong communication skills. And in Indonesia's competitive tech scene, where hundreds of engineers might have similar technical skills, communication is often what sets you apart.

I've interviewed hundreds of engineers. I've rejected brilliant coders who couldn't explain their thinking. I've hired engineers with decent technical skills but exceptional communication abilities. Why? Because clear communicators multiply their impact. They make their whole team better.

## The Written Word: Your Most Important Tool

As a software engineer, you probably write more than you code. Slack messages, documentation, pull requests, design docs, emails, code comments. Your words live forever in systems and become the institutional memory of your team.

### Documentation: Writing for Your Future Self

I used to hate writing documentation. "The code is self-documenting," I'd tell myself. Then I came back to my own code six months later and had no idea what it did or why I'd made certain decisions.

Documentation isn't just for others—it's for future you. And future you will be grateful when you write:
- Why you made a decision, not just what the code does
- The alternatives you considered and why you rejected them
- Known limitations or edge cases
- How to run, test, and deploy
- Examples of common use cases

**Good documentation is specific and actionable:**

Bad: "This function handles user input."

Good: "This function validates user input for the registration form. It checks email format, password strength (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number), and ensures the username isn't already taken. Returns validation errors as an array. Note: Rate limited to prevent abuse—max 5 attempts per IP per minute."

### Pull Requests: Tell a Story

Your pull request is not just code—it's a story about a problem and your solution. A good PR description should answer:

1. **What problem does this solve?** Context matters. Link to the issue or ticket.

2. **How does it solve it?** High-level approach before they dive into code.

3. **Why this approach?** Especially if there are trade-offs or alternative approaches.

4. **What should reviewers focus on?** Guide their attention to complex or risky areas.

5. **How to test it?** Clear steps to verify the fix works.

**Example of a good PR description:**

```
## Problem
Users are experiencing timeout errors on the dashboard when they have >1000 projects 
(reported in #4523). The current implementation loads all projects upfront, causing 
the database query to take 30+ seconds for power users.

## Solution
Implemented pagination with infinite scroll on the dashboard projects view.
- Backend: Added pagination to the `/api/projects` endpoint (limit: 50 per request)
- Frontend: Implemented intersection observer for infinite scroll
- Added loading states and error handling

## Why This Approach
Considered these alternatives:
1. Increase database indexes: Helped but wasn't enough for power users
2. Full frontend pagination: Would require UX changes and disrupt workflow
3. Virtual scrolling: More complex to implement and maintain

Chose infinite scroll because it maintains existing UX while solving performance issues.

## Review Focus
- Backend pagination logic in `projects_controller.rb` (lines 45-67)
- Race condition handling when user scrolls quickly (lines 89-102)

## Testing
1. Create test user with 1000+ projects (use seed script: `rake db:seed_projects`)
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Scroll down—projects should load in batches of 50
4. Check network tab—should see paginated API calls
5. Verify it works on mobile (Safari iOS, Chrome Android)

## Performance
Before: 30s+ for 1000 projects
After: <2s initial load, ~500ms per subsequent page
```

This tells reviewers everything they need to know before they read a single line of code.

### Code Comments: When and How

There's a debate in the industry: should code be self-documenting or should you comment everything? The answer is nuanced.

**Comment the "why," not the "what":**

Bad comment:
```javascript
// Increment counter
counter++;
```

Good comment:
```javascript
// We increment before the API call because the server expects 
// the counter to include this request. See ticket #2847 for
// context on why we changed this from post-increment.
counter++;
```

**Comment on non-obvious decisions:**
```python
# Using MD5 here instead of SHA256 because this is for cache keys,
# not security. MD5 is faster and collision risk is acceptable for
# our use case (max 10k items, short-lived cache).
cache_key = hashlib.md5(user_data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Comment on complex algorithms:**
```java
/**
 * Implements binary search with early termination optimization.
 * For our dataset (sorted by timestamp), 90% of queries are for
 * recent items, so we check the last 10 items first before
 * doing full binary search. This gives us O(1) for common case,
 * O(log n) for worst case.
 */
```

### Async Communication: Master of Remote Work

In Indonesia's growing remote work culture, especially with global companies, async communication is critical. Many Indonesian engineers now work with teams across the US, Europe, or Singapore—different time zones mean async is your lifeline.

**Key principles for async communication:**

**1. Default to Over-communication**

In person, you can see confusion on someone's face and clarify immediately. In async, you can't. So err on the side of too much context.

Bad Slack message:
```
"The build is broken"
```

Good Slack message:
```
"❌ Production build failing on master (commit a3f7e9)

Issue: New dependency @types/react@18.2.0 has type conflicts with our existing code
Impact: Blocking deployments since 10:00 AM WIB
Fix: I'm working on a patch, ETA 30 minutes
Workaround: Can pin to @types/react@18.1.0 if urgent deployment needed

Thread below with details 👇
```

**2. Use Threading and Structure**

Long messages lose people. Use structure:
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- Use bullet points and formatting
- Put the conclusion first (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front)
- Use emojis strategically for scanning (✅ ❌ 🚨 ⚠️ 📝)

**3. Write for Asynchronous Response**

Don't send: "Hey"

And then wait for response before asking your question. Instead:

"Hey @Sarah! Question about the auth flow refactor. I'm implementing the token refresh logic and wondering: should we refresh tokens proactively (before expiry) or reactively (on 401)? I'm leaning toward proactive (refresh at 80% of TTL) because it's smoother UX, but wanted to check if there's a reason we're doing reactive now. Context: working on #issue-2847. No rush, whenever you have a moment! 🙏"

This gives them all the context to respond when they're available, even if it's 8 hours later.

**4. Status Updates Without Micromanagement**

When working remotely, especially across time zones, proactive updates prevent anxiety and unnecessary check-ins.

**Daily standups in async (example format):**
```
📅 Monday, Oct 30

✅ Yesterday:
- Finished user authentication endpoints
- PR #234 merged
- Started on password reset flow

🔄 Today:
- Complete password reset backend
- Write unit tests
- Start email templates

🚧 Blockers:
- Need design review on email templates from @Budi
- Waiting on staging environment credentials

💭 Notes:
- Estimates looking good, on track for Friday deadline
```

This takes 2 minutes to write but saves 30 minutes of meetings and back-and-forth.

## Verbal Communication: Speaking Is a Skill

For many engineers, especially in Indonesia where English might not be your first language, verbal communication can feel intimidating. I get it—I struggled with this too.

### The Art of Technical Explanations

Being able to explain complex technical concepts simply is a superpower. Here's a framework that works:

**The 3-Level Explanation:**

1. **Executive summary (30 seconds):** What and why in plain language
2. **Technical overview (2 minutes):** How it works for technical people
3. **Deep dive (5+ minutes):** Implementation details for specialists

**Example: Explaining a microservices migration**

**Level 1 (for CEO):**
"We're breaking our application into smaller pieces that can be developed and deployed independently. This means we can ship features faster and our system will be more reliable because one piece breaking doesn't take down the whole system."

**Level 2 (for product manager):**
"Our monolithic application is being split into services: user service, payment service, product service, etc. Each service has its own database and can be deployed separately. This means the payments team can deploy without coordinating with the product team. Communication between services happens via REST APIs. Migration will take 6 months, starting with least risky services first."

**Level 3 (for engineering team):**
"We're using domain-driven design to identify bounded contexts. Starting with the payment service because it has the clearest boundaries. Using event-driven architecture with Kafka for async communication between services. Each service gets its own PostgreSQL instance. Implementing the Saga pattern for distributed transactions. We'll use API Gateway pattern for routing and service discovery with Consul..."

**Know your audience and start at their level.** You can always go deeper if they ask.

### Meetings: Make Them Count

Meetings get a bad rap in tech, often deserved. But when done right, they're powerful.

**Before the meeting:**
- Have a clear agenda shared in advance
- Define the meeting goal (decision? brainstorming? information sharing?)
- Send background materials so people can prepare
- Invite only people who need to be there

**During the meeting:**
- Start on time (respecting people's time builds trust)
- Assign a note-taker (rotate this responsibility)
- Keep discussions on topic
- Parking lot for off-topic but important points
- Make sure quiet people are heard ("Putri, we haven't heard from you—any thoughts?")
- End with clear action items and owners

**After the meeting:**
- Send summary with decisions and action items
- Tag people with their specific action items
- Include deadlines

**Indonesian context note:** In Indonesian culture, there's often hesitance to speak up in meetings, especially with senior people present. If you're leading a meeting, actively create space for junior voices. If you're junior, practice speaking up even when it's uncomfortable—your perspective matters.

### Presentations: Technical Talks Without Fear

Whether it's a team demo, conference talk, or stakeholder presentation, public speaking is part of a senior engineer's role.

**Structure for technical presentations:**

**1. Hook (1 minute):** Start with something interesting
- A surprising statistic
- A relatable problem
- A dramatic story

"Last month, our API went down for 4 hours. We lost $50,000 in revenue. Today I'm going to show you the one change that would have prevented this."

**2. Context (2-3 minutes):** Why does this matter?
- What problem are we solving?
- Who does it affect?
- What happens if we don't solve it?

**3. Solution (10-15 minutes):** Your main content
- Start with the big picture
- Then dive into details
- Use visuals (architecture diagrams, code snippets, demos)
- Tell stories and use examples

**4. Impact (2-3 minutes):** What changed?
- Before and after metrics
- Benefits realized
- Lessons learned

**5. Q&A:** Leave time for questions

**Presentation tips:**
- **Practice out loud:** You'll discover awkward phrasings
- **Time yourself:** Respect the allocated time
- **Slow down:** Nervous speakers talk fast. Consciously slow down.
- **Pause:** Silence is okay. It lets ideas sink in.
- **Tell stories:** People remember stories, not bullet points
- **Handle questions gracefully:** "That's a great question" (gives you time to think), "I don't know, but I'll find out" (honesty wins respect)

**For Indonesian engineers presenting in English:** Your accent is not a problem. Clear thinking and good structure matter far more than perfect pronunciation. Some of the best technical presentations I've seen were from non-native English speakers who prepared well and communicated clearly.

## Cross-Cultural Communication

Indonesia's tech ecosystem is increasingly global. You might work with:
- American colleagues who value directness
- Japanese clients who value formality
- Australian teams who value informality
- European partners who value work-life boundaries
- Singaporean managers who value efficiency

**Key differences to navigate:**

**Direct vs. Indirect Communication:**
- Western cultures (especially US) tend toward directness: "This design won't work because..."
- Asian cultures (including Indonesia) tend toward indirectness: "Perhaps we could consider an alternative approach..."

Neither is better, but know which style your context requires. In code reviews, lean toward directness (but kind). In stakeholder discussions, adjust to your audience.

**Formality:**
Indonesian culture often emphasizes respect for hierarchy. In global teams, you might find:
- US teams calling CEOs by first name
- Start-ups with no titles
- Open disagreement with managers

This can feel uncomfortable at first. Remember: professional respect doesn't require formality. You can disagree respectfully.

**Time and Urgency:**
"Urgent" in Jakarta might mean "today." "Urgent" in Silicon Valley might mean "within the hour." Clarify timing expectations explicitly.

**Language Barriers:**
If English is not your first language and you're working with native English speakers:
- Ask for clarification without apologizing: "Could you rephrase that?" not "Sorry, my English is bad."
- Write things down in meetings
- Follow up in writing to confirm understanding
- Use simpler words yourself—clear communication beats fancy vocabulary

**Cultural tip:** When working with international teams, be explicit about Indonesian holidays and working hours. Don't assume others know when Ramadan is or that work schedules might shift during lebaran. Over-communicate cultural context.

## Communicating with Non-Technical Stakeholders

This is where many engineers struggle. Your job is to translate between technical reality and business goals.

### Understanding Their Perspective

Product managers care about user value and timelines.
CEOs care about revenue and company strategy.
Designers care about user experience.
Support teams care about customer pain points.

They don't care about your elegant code architecture. They care about outcomes. Frame technical discussions in terms of business impact.

**Bad:**
"We need to refactor the authentication system to use JWT instead of session-based auth because it's more stateless and scalable."

**Better:**
"Our current login system limits us to one server region. If we make this change, we can expand to Singapore and reduce latency for international users by 60%. The work will take 2 weeks but won't disrupt users."

### The Yes-And Approach

When non-technical people propose solutions, they often jump to implementation details without understanding constraints. Instead of shooting them down, use "yes-and":

**PM:** "Can we add real-time video chat to the app?"

**Bad response:** "No, that's way too complex."

**Better response:** "Yes, real-time communication would be valuable. Video specifically is complex—we'd need to integrate a third-party service like Twilio, handle bandwidth issues, and it would take 6-8 weeks. What's the core problem we're trying to solve? If it's instant communication, we could start with text chat and voice messages—those are faster to implement and solve 80% of the use case. Then we can evaluate video in Q2 if needed."

You're not saying no. You're exploring options and trade-offs collaboratively.

### Saying No to Bad Ideas (Gracefully)

Sometimes you do need to push back on technical grounds. Do it with respect and alternatives.

**Framework for pushback:**

1. **Acknowledge the goal:** "I understand we want to launch faster."
2. **Explain the constraint:** "Skipping security testing creates risk."
3. **Quantify if possible:** "We've seen 3 security breaches in the past year that cost us $X each."
4. **Offer alternatives:** "We could launch with a smaller feature set that's been tested, or we could extend the timeline by one week to test the full version."
5. **Let them decide:** "What makes more sense given our priorities?"

## The Feedback Loop: Giving and Receiving

### Code Reviews: The Communication Minefield

Code reviews are where communication skills matter most. You're giving feedback on someone's work, which can feel personal.

**Principles for good code review comments:**

**1. Be specific and constructive**

Bad: "This code is messy."

Good: "This function is doing three different things. Consider splitting it into `validateInput()`, `processData()`, and `saveToDatabase()` for clarity and testability."

**2. Ask questions instead of making demands**

Bad: "Change this to use async/await."

Good: "Have you considered using async/await here? It might make the error handling clearer. If you prefer promises, that's fine, but wanted to flag it."

**3. Explain the why**

Bad: "Use const instead of let."

Good: "Consider using const instead of let here. Since this value isn't reassigned, const communicates intent more clearly and prevents accidental mutations."

**4. Praise good code**

Code reviews aren't just for criticism. When you see good code, say so:
- "Nice abstraction here!"
- "This test coverage is excellent."
- "Great naming—very readable."

Positive feedback builds team morale and reinforces good practices.

**5. Distinguish between preferences and requirements**

Make it clear what's optional:
- "Nit: You could rename this variable to `userId` for consistency, but not blocking approval."
- "Suggestion: Consider extracting this to a helper function."
- "Blocker: This needs input validation before we can merge."

**6. Be culturally aware**

In Indonesia, direct criticism can be uncomfortable. Balance honesty with kindness:
- "This works, and here's how we could make it even better..."
- "I learned this the hard way: [your mistake], so I always [better approach]."

Frame feedback as shared learning, not judgment.

### Receiving Feedback: The Growth Mindset

When you get code review feedback, especially critical feedback, the natural response is defensiveness. Fight that urge.

**Instead:**
- **Assume good intent:** They're trying to make the code better, not attack you
- **Ask for clarification:** "Could you explain what you mean by [comment]?"
- **Acknowledge good points:** "Good catch, I hadn't considered that edge case."
- **Push back respectfully when needed:** "I chose this approach because [reason]. Open to discussing alternatives."
- **Thank reviewers:** "Thanks for the thorough review!" (even if it stings)

**Remember:** Every senior engineer has had their code torn apart in reviews. It's how you grow. The engineers who excel are the ones who learn from feedback instead of resisting it.

## Difficult Conversations

### Addressing Performance Issues

If you're leading a team or mentoring someone, eventually you'll need to address performance issues. This is hard, especially in Indonesian culture where direct confrontation is often avoided.

**Framework for difficult conversations:**

**1. Prepare:**
- Have specific examples ready
- Focus on behaviors, not personality
- Know what outcome you want

**2. Private setting:**
Never criticize publicly. Always in private.

**3. Use "I" statements:**
"I've noticed that the last three deadlines were missed" not "You're always late."

**4. Listen:**
There might be context you don't know—health issues, family problems, unclear expectations.

**5. Collaborate on solution:**
"How can we address this?" not "Here's what you need to do."

**6. Follow up:**
Set clear expectations and check in regularly.

### Negotiating Salary and Promotions

Communication skills directly impact your compensation. When negotiating:

**Do your research:**
Know market rates (use Glassdoor, levels.fyi, talk to peers). In Indonesia, salaries vary widely by company type—startups vs. tech unicorns vs. multinational companies.

**Quantify your impact:**
Not: "I've been working hard."
Instead: "Over the past year, I've delivered 3 major features that increased user engagement by 25%, mentored 2 junior engineers, and reduced API latency by 40%."

**Make it a conversation:**
"Based on my contributions and market research, I believe $X is appropriate. What are your thoughts?"

**Be prepared to walk away:**
If they can't meet your requirements and you have options, it's okay to look elsewhere. But do it professionally.

## Building Influence Through Communication

Senior engineers aren't just good coders—they're people who influence technical direction. This requires strategic communication.

### Writing Design Docs

For significant changes, write design docs that:
- Clearly state the problem
- Propose your solution
- Discuss alternatives you considered
- Address potential concerns proactively
- Invite feedback before implementation

Good design docs build consensus before you write code.

### Building Advocates

You can't do everything alone. Build advocates for your ideas:
- **Share drafts early:** Get input before you're attached to a solution
- **Give credit generously:** "Building on Rani's idea..."
- **Listen to concerns:** Even if you disagree
- **Find champions:** Senior folks who believe in your idea
- **Be patient:** Organizational change takes time

### Technical Blogging and Presentations

Want to accelerate your career? Share what you know:
- **Internal tech talks:** Share learnings with your team
- **External conference speaking:** Build your reputation
- **Technical blog posts:** Demonstrate expertise
- **Open source documentation:** Help the community

In Indonesia, the tech community is growing but still relatively small. Being active in communities like Tech in Asia, DevDiscuss Indonesia, or local meetups can significantly boost your career.

## Communication Tools and Practices

### The Tools

**Synchronous:**
- Slack/Discord for quick questions
- Zoom/Google Meet for meetings
- Pair programming for complex work

**Asynchronous:**
- Email for formal communication
- Notion/Confluence for documentation
- GitHub/GitLab for code and discussions
- Loom for video explanations

**Choose the right tool:**
- Quick question? Slack
- Complex topic? Video call or doc
- Needs to be searchable? Document it
- Needs multiple people's input? Doc with comments, not Slack thread

### Daily Practices

**Morning:**
- Check messages and respond to urgent items
- Post standup update (if async)
- Review calendar and prepare for meetings

**Throughout day:**
- Respond to messages within reasonable time (but not instantly—you need focus time)
- Document decisions as you make them
- Over-communicate status on critical work

**End of day:**
- Update task status
- Respond to any pending items
- Set tomorrow's priorities

### The 24-Hour Rule

Before sending an emotionally charged message—angry, frustrated, defensive—wait 24 hours. Write it, save it as a draft, sleep on it. Revise the next day with a clear head.

You'll thank yourself. Many career-limiting moves happen in angry emails or Slack messages.

## Common Communication Pitfalls for Engineers

### 1. The Curse of Knowledge

You know too much. You forget that others don't have your context. Always start explanations with fundamentals.

### 2. Too Much Jargon

Technical jargon is useful with technical people. But even then, simpler language is often clearer. "The service went down" beats "We experienced a P0 incident in the availability domain."

### 3. Assuming Instead of Asking

"I thought you meant X" kills projects. When in doubt, ask clarifying questions. Better to feel silly for asking than to build the wrong thing.

### 4. Not Reading the Room

Pay attention to verbal and non-verbal cues. If people look confused, pause and check understanding. If they're looking at their phones, you've lost them.

### 5. Over-Promising

"I can definitely finish that by Friday" (when you're not sure) creates credibility problems. Better to under-promise and over-deliver.

### 6. Ghosting

Not responding to messages, especially from teammates, damages trust. If you're busy, acknowledge receipt and set expectations: "Got it, will look at this tomorrow."

## Indonesian Context: Navigating Local Culture

Working in Indonesia's tech scene has unique communication dynamics:

### Hierarchy and Respect

Indonesian culture values respect for seniority and hierarchy. In meetings, junior engineers might hesitate to contradict senior ones, even when they're right.

**If you're junior:** Practice respectful disagreement. "That's a good point, Pak. I'm wondering if we should also consider [alternative] because [reason]."

**If you're senior:** Create safety for dissent. "I want to hear all perspectives, especially if you disagree with me." Act on this—don't punish people for speaking up.

### Face-Saving

Direct confrontation can cause loss of face. When giving negative feedback, do it privately and frame it constructively.

Instead of: "Your code has bugs" (in a public channel)
Try: [Private message] "Hey, I noticed a few edge cases we should handle in the PR. Want to pair on it this afternoon?"

### Language Code-Switching

Many Indonesian tech teams mix Bahasa Indonesia and English. This is fine, but be mindful:
- In international meetings, stick to English
- When writing documentation for the broader company, use English
- In team chats, whatever works for the team
- Don't make assumptions about English proficiency

### Work-Life Boundaries

Indonesian culture can blur work and personal relationships. You might be friends with coworkers on WhatsApp, attend team gatherings, or even know their families. This is beautiful, but also requires care:
- Maintain professionalism even in informal settings
- Be mindful of religious and cultural sensitivities
- Don't gossip—it spreads fast in tight-knit teams
- Work friendships are real, but remember they're also professional relationships

## Measuring Your Progress

How do you know if you're improving? Watch for these signals:

**Positive indicators:**
- People seek your opinion in technical discussions
- Your PRs get fewer "please clarify" comments
- You're invited to represent your team in meetings
- Junior engineers ask you questions
- Stakeholders understand your explanations
- You get positive feedback on presentations
- Your documentation is referenced by others

**Keep improving if:**
- You often have to re-explain things
- People seem confused after your explanations
- You get defensive when receiving feedback
- Your PRs have many back-and-forth clarifications
- You're rarely included in planning discussions
- You avoid presentations or difficult conversations

## Final Thoughts: Your Career Depends On This

I want to be very direct: you can be the best coder on your team, but if you can't communicate effectively, your career will plateau. You'll stay an individual contributor while less technically skilled engineers who communicate well become tech leads, architects, and engineering managers.

This isn't fair, but it's reality. Software engineering is a team sport. Teams need people who can articulate problems, explain solutions, build consensus, and bring others along.

The good news? Communication is a skill, not a talent. You can learn it. You can practice it. You can improve it.

When I started my career, I was a terrible communicator. I wrote one-line pull requests. I stayed silent in meetings. I got defensive in code reviews. I couldn't explain my work to non-technical people.

It took years of deliberate practice, embarrassing mistakes, and patient mentors to get better. I'm still learning.

But learning to communicate well has multiplied my impact. It's the difference between being a decent engineer and being someone who shapes technical direction, mentors others, and drives significant projects.

So start today. Write better documentation. Explain your thinking. Ask questions. Give thoughtful feedback. Practice presenting. Have difficult conversations.

Your code will rot and be rewritten. Your explanations, your documentation, your relationships—those compound over your career.

Master the art of communication, and you'll not only be a better engineer—you'll be the kind of engineer that companies fight to hire and teams love to work with.

Now close your laptop, find a colleague, and have a real conversation. Practice starts now.
