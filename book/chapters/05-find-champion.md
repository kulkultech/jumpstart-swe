# Chapter 5: Find Your Champion

When I was trying to break into my dream company, I sent 47 applications over six months. Zero responses. Not even a rejection email.

Then I met Sarah at a tech meetup. We talked about microservices architecture for 20 minutes. She worked at that exact company I'd been applying to. We stayed in touch, shared articles, discussed tech problems. Three months later, she mentioned an opening on her team and asked if I'd be interested.

Within two weeks, I had three interviews scheduled. Within a month, I had an offer—for a role that was never even posted publicly.

The difference? Sarah became my champion.

This chapter isn't about networking tips or LinkedIn optimization. This is about finding someone inside your target company who believes in you enough to stake their reputation on bringing you in. Someone who will walk your resume to the hiring manager's desk. Someone who will advocate for you when you're not in the room.

Let me show you how to find your champion—the real shortcut to landing roles at companies like Gojek, Tokopedia, or any company you're targeting.

## What Is a Champion, Really?

First, let's get clear on what we're talking about, because "champion" is not the same as "referral."

### The Difference Between a Referral and a Champion

**A referral** is someone who submits your resume to their company's system. They might not even know you well—you went to the same university, you have a mutual friend, or you reached out on LinkedIn. They click a button, maybe add a line saying "this person seems qualified," and that's it.

**A champion** is someone who actively advocates for you. They:
- Talk to hiring managers about you specifically
- Push for your resume to be prioritized
- Prep you on the interview process and team dynamics
- Follow up on your application status
- Defend your candidacy in hiring discussions
- Sometimes even create a position for you if none exists

The difference is night and day. I've seen referrals get ignored. I've never seen a champion's candidate get ignored.

### Why Champions Are So Powerful

Here's something most people don't realize: **most hiring decisions are made before the interview process even starts**.

When a hiring manager receives a resume from a trusted team member who says, "This person is exactly what we need—I've worked with them on open source, they're sharp, they'd be perfect for the payments team," that candidate is already 70% of the way to an offer.

Why? Because hiring is risky and expensive. A bad hire costs 6-12 months of salary, team morale, and project delays. When someone internally vouches for you, it dramatically reduces the perceived risk.

In the Indonesian tech scene, this is even more critical. At companies like Gojek or Tokopedia, internal recommendations can fast-track you through what would otherwise be a 3-4 month process. I've seen candidates go from first conversation to offer in two weeks because a respected engineer championed them.

## The Champion's Motivation: Why Would They Help You?

Before we talk about finding champions, you need to understand why someone would champion you. Nobody wakes up thinking, "Today I'll spend my political capital and reputation on a stranger."

Champions advocate for you when:

### 1. You Solve a Problem They Have

This is the most powerful motivator. If their team is struggling with React performance and you're a React optimization expert who's been helping them debug issues on Stack Overflow, you've demonstrated value before ever applying.

**Example:** Adi, a Jakarta-based developer, noticed that Tokopedia's Android app was slower than competitors on low-end devices (common in Indonesia). He wrote a detailed blog post analyzing the performance bottlenecks with specific solutions. A Tokopedia mobile engineer saw it, reached out, and within weeks, Adi was interviewing for a mobile optimization role that was created specifically for him.

### 2. You've Built a Genuine Relationship

People help people they know and like. Notice I said "genuine"—not transactional networking where you're obviously just mining for job opportunities.

If you've been attending the same meetups, contributing to the same open-source projects, or engaging thoughtfully in the same online communities, relationships naturally form. When an opportunity arises, these people think of you.

### 3. You Make Them Look Good

Here's the truth: championing great candidates makes people look good. If you join the team and excel, the person who brought you in gets credit. They've demonstrated good judgment, they've improved their team, and they've proven they can spot talent.

This creates an incentive to champion strong candidates. You're not asking for a favor—you're offering them a win.

### 4. They Believe in Paying It Forward

Many people remember when someone helped them get their break. They want to do the same for others. This is especially common among engineers who came from non-traditional backgrounds or who struggled to break into tech.

If you approach these people respectfully and demonstrate genuine potential, they'll often go out of their way to help—not because they owe you anything, but because someone once did the same for them.

## Types of Champions (and How to Find Each)

Not all champions are equal. Different types of champions have different strengths and require different approaches to find.

### The Hiring Manager Champion

**Power Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Difficulty to Find:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is the holy grail. The hiring manager directly controls hiring decisions. If they want to hire you, you're probably getting hired.

**How to Find Them:**
- They often speak at conferences or write on company engineering blogs
- They're active in niche technical communities related to their team's focus
- They sometimes post "we're hiring" messages with specific technical details
- They appear on company podcast appearances or tech talks

**The Approach:**
Don't lead with "Can you hire me?" Lead with value and expertise in their domain.

1. Find their blog posts or talks
2. Engage with their content meaningfully (not just "great post!")
3. Share your own insights on the same topics
4. Contribute to problems they've publicly mentioned
5. Build a relationship over months, not days
6. When the timing is right, express interest in their team's work

**Real Story:** When Budi wanted to join Gojek's infrastructure team, he identified the team lead through their tech blog. He started contributing to an open-source tool the team maintained. After three months of quality contributions, the team lead reached out asking if Budi would be interested in joining. The "application" was a conversation, not a resume submission.

### The Team Member Champion

**Power Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Difficulty to Find:** ⭐⭐⭐

Engineers on the team don't make final hiring decisions, but their opinion carries weight. If several team members want you, the hiring manager listens.

**How to Find Them:**
- LinkedIn searches: "[Company Name] + [Technology]"
- GitHub: Contributors to company's open-source projects
- Tech meetups and conferences (Jakarta has vibrant tech meetups)
- Online communities: Telegram groups, Discord servers, tech Slack communities
- Stack Overflow: Engineers who answer questions and mention their company

**The Approach:**
Team members are more accessible than hiring managers but have less direct power. Your strategy should be volume—connect with multiple people on the same team.

1. Attend meetups where they present
2. Contribute to their open-source projects
3. Engage in online communities they're active in
4. Ask for informational interviews about their experience
5. Share your work and get their feedback

**Why Multiple Matters:** If three different engineers on the same team separately mention you to their manager ("Hey, I met this developer at a meetup, they're really sharp"), that manager will pay attention. It's social proof on steroids.

### The Peer Champion (Someone at Your Level)

**Power Level:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Difficulty to Find:** ⭐⭐

Peers don't have hiring authority, but they have insider knowledge and can be your advocate from within.

**How to Find Them:**
- Alumni from your university working at target companies
- Former colleagues who've moved to companies you're interested in
- People who started their careers around the same time as you
- Bootcamp alumni networks
- Junior engineers active in learning communities

**The Approach:**
Peers are the easiest to build genuine friendships with because there's no power dynamic.

1. Share learning resources and tips
2. Study together for interviews
3. Review each other's code or projects
4. Celebrate each other's wins
5. When they join a company, stay in touch
6. Ask about their experience and what the team needs

**The Long Game:** Peers become senior engineers and hiring managers. That junior developer you help today might be the tech lead making hiring decisions in three years. I've gotten opportunities from people I studied algorithms with five years earlier.

### The Recruiter Champion

**Power Level:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Difficulty to Find:** ⭐

Technical recruiters can be champions, especially if you're exactly what they need for a role they're struggling to fill.

**How to Find Them:**
- LinkedIn (search "[Company] technical recruiter")
- Tech hiring events
- Company career pages often list recruiter contacts
- Recruiting agencies specializing in tech

**The Approach:**
Recruiters respond to candidates who make their job easy.

1. Have a clear, well-formatted resume
2. Be specific about what you want and what you're good at
3. Respond quickly to messages
4. Be professional and prepared for calls
5. Understand the role requirements deeply
6. Show enthusiasm for the company

**Real Example:** Siti connected with a Grab recruiter on LinkedIn. Instead of asking for a job, she asked what skills were most in-demand for their mobile team. The recruiter mentioned they needed someone with Flutter and payment systems experience. Siti spent two months building a Flutter payment demo app. When she sent it to the recruiter, it was exactly what they needed. She got an interview within days.

### The External Champion (Someone Who Left the Company)

**Power Level:** ⭐⭐  
**Difficulty to Find:** ⭐⭐⭐

People who recently left a company still have relationships there. They can make introductions and provide insider insights without conflict of interest.

**How to Find Them:**
- LinkedIn: Search for people who list the company in past experience
- Alumni networks
- People who've written about why they left (blog posts, Twitter)
- Former employees are often happy to help because they're not competing with you

**The Approach:**
1. Acknowledge they no longer work there but respect their experience
2. Ask about their time at the company—what they learned, what they'd recommend
3. If rapport builds, ask if they'd be comfortable making an introduction
4. Use their insights to prepare for interviews

## The Strategic Approach: Finding Your Champion in 90 Days

Now let's put this into action with a concrete plan.

### Month 1: Research and Position Yourself

**Week 1-2: Target Selection**
- Identify 5-10 companies you want to join
- Research each company's teams, tech stacks, and public engineering content
- Find 10-15 engineers at each company (use LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, company blogs)
- Create a spreadsheet to track: Name, Role, Team, Contact Method, Last Interaction

**Week 3-4: Build Your Presence**
- Publish technical content related to your target companies' tech stacks
- Contribute to open-source projects used by these companies
- Optimize your LinkedIn profile with relevant keywords
- Update your GitHub with well-documented projects
- Start engaging with target engineers' content (comment thoughtfully on their posts)

**The Indonesian Context:** In Jakarta's tech scene, WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels are huge. Join Indonesia tech communities like:
- DevDiscuss Indonesia
- IndoDevs
- Tech in Asia Indonesia Community
- Company-specific communities (e.g., "Gojek Tech Community")

*Note: Community names and platforms evolve. Search for "Indonesia tech community," "Jakarta developer meetup," or "[company name] community" to find current active groups.*

### Month 2: Build Relationships

**The Coffee Chat Campaign**
- Reach out to 10 people with personalized messages
- Goal: Have 5 informational interviews (even 20-minute calls)
- Focus on learning, not asking for jobs

**The Message Template That Works:**

> Hi [Name],
> 
> I came across your article on [specific topic] and found your approach to [specific technical challenge] really insightful. I'm a [your role] working on [relevant area], and I've been exploring [related topic] lately.
> 
> I noticed you're on the [team name] team at [Company]. I'm really interested in learning more about how you approach [specific technical area] at scale. Would you be open to a brief 15-20 minute call? I'd love to hear about your experience.
> 
> No pressure at all—I know you're busy. Either way, thanks for the great content you're putting out!
> 
> [Your name]

**What Makes This Work:**
- It's specific (shows you actually read their work)
- It's not asking for a job
- It's time-bounded (15-20 minutes, not open-ended)
- It offers an easy out
- It's genuine

**In-Person Opportunities:**
- Attend 2-3 tech meetups in Jakarta (or your city)
- Prepare thoughtful questions to ask speakers
- Follow up with people you meet within 24 hours

**The Follow-Up System:**
After each conversation:
1. Send a thank-you message within 24 hours
2. Reference something specific from your conversation
3. Share something valuable (article, resource related to what they mentioned)
4. Add to your tracking spreadsheet with notes
5. Set a reminder to follow up in 4-6 weeks

### Month 3: Move Toward the Ask

By month three, you should have built rapport with several people. Now you transition to expressing interest.

**The Transition Conversation:**

After your second or third interaction with someone, if they work at a company you're targeting:

> I really appreciate you taking the time to chat over the past few months. Learning about [specific aspect] has been incredibly valuable. 
> 
> I've been thinking a lot about my next career move, and honestly, [Company] keeps coming to mind—especially the work your team is doing in [specific area]. I've noticed there's an opening for [role], and it seems like a great fit for my background in [your experience].
> 
> Would you be comfortable with me listing you as a referral when I apply? I'd be happy to send you my resume and a summary of why I think I'd be a good fit. No pressure at all—I know that's asking you to vouch for me, and I completely understand if it's not the right time.

**Why This Works:**
- You've built credibility over time
- You're specific about what role and why
- You acknowledge the ask (putting their reputation on the line)
- You make it easy for them to say yes or no
- You're prepared with materials

### The Application Strategy

When you're ready to apply:

1. **Apply through the referral system** if your champion works there
2. **Send your champion a one-page summary:**
   - Your background (3-4 bullets)
   - Why you're interested (specific reasons related to the company/team)
   - Why you'd be a good fit (match to role requirements)
   - Your resume attached

3. **Make their job easy.** Don't make them figure out why you're qualified. Tell them exactly what to say when they advocate for you.

4. **Keep them updated** on your application status, but don't be pushy. A message like "Just wanted to let you know I had my first interview—thanks so much for the referral!" is perfect.

## Red Flags: When Someone Can't Be Your Champion

Not everyone can be your champion, even if they like you. Watch for these signs:

### They're Too Junior
Someone in their first year at the company doesn't have the credibility to champion you yet. They can refer you, but they can't advocate effectively.

### They're on the Way Out
If someone is planning to leave or is unhappy at the company, their recommendation carries less weight.

### They Don't Know You Well Enough
If someone says "sure, I'll refer you" after one conversation, they're being polite, not championing you. Real champions have seen your work or spent meaningful time with you.

### They're Not on the Team You're Targeting
A backend engineer can't effectively champion you for a mobile role. They don't know the team's needs or work directly with the hiring manager.

### They've Referred Too Many People
Some people refer everyone who asks. This dilutes their credibility. If a hiring manager sees five referrals from the same person in a month, they stop trusting that person's judgment.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Champion Relationships

I've seen people blow potential champion relationships with these mistakes:

### Mistake 1: The Transactional Ask

> "Hi, I saw you work at Google. Can you refer me?"

This is the LinkedIn message version of walking up to someone at a party and immediately asking them to loan you money. It might work 1% of the time, but it's not a real strategy.

**Fix:** Build relationships before asking for anything.

### Mistake 2: The Mass Referral Request

Asking 20 people at the same company for referrals makes you look desperate and damages all those relationships.

**Fix:** Focus on 1-2 potential champions per company, maximum.

### Mistake 3: Not Doing Your Homework

Asking someone to champion you when you clearly don't understand their company or the role wastes their time and yours.

**Fix:** Research deeply before reaching out. Show you understand what the company does and why you'd be a good fit.

### Mistake 4: Disappearing After the Referral

Getting a referral and then ghosting the person is unprofessional. Even if you don't get the job, update them and thank them.

**Fix:** Keep your champion updated throughout the process, win or lose.

### Mistake 5: Not Respecting Their Time

Asking for hour-long meetings, calling without scheduling, or sending walls of text shows you don't value their time.

**Fix:** Be concise, schedule in advance, and stick to agreed-upon time limits.

### Mistake 6: Being Dishonest

Exaggerating your skills or experience puts your champion in an awful position. If you bomb the interview, they look bad for recommending you.

**Fix:** Be honest about your abilities. Real champions want to help you succeed, which means matching you with roles you can actually do.

## The Indonesian Context: Cultural Considerations

Finding champions in Indonesia has unique dynamics shaped by local culture:

### Relationships Matter More

Indonesian business culture values personal relationships heavily. The concept of "orang dalam" (inside person) is real and powerful. This actually works to your advantage if you approach it correctly—but only with authentic connections. Indonesians are particularly good at spotting transactional relationship-building, so focus on building real, long-term connections.

### University Alumni Networks Are Gold

In Indonesia, university networks ("alumni") carry significant weight. If you share an alma mater with someone at your target company, mention it. Many Indonesian tech leaders went to ITB, UI, or ITS—these networks are active and supportive.

**Action:** Search LinkedIn for "[Company Name] + [Your University]"

### The Power of "Kenalan" (Introductions)

Rather than cold outreach, getting introduced through a mutual connection is much more effective in Indonesian culture.

**Strategy:** Instead of messaging someone directly, see if you have mutual connections who could introduce you.

### Tech Communities Are Tight-Knit

Jakarta's tech community is relatively small and interconnected. People know each other across companies. A good reputation in the community opens many doors.

**Action:** Contribute to local open-source projects, attend meetups, be helpful in community Telegram groups.

### Language Matters

While tech companies use English, being able to speak Indonesian fluently in casual conversations helps build rapport. Don't shy away from mixing languages in informal settings.

## Real Success Stories: How Champions Changed Careers

Let me share three real examples from my network (names and some details changed for privacy):

### Rina: From Bootcamp to Tokopedia

Rina completed a coding bootcamp and was struggling to get interviews. She noticed that Tokopedia engineers frequently answered questions on Stack Overflow Indonesia.

She started:
1. Asking thoughtful questions about e-commerce architecture
2. Implementing suggestions and reporting back on what worked
3. Eventually answering questions herself, sometimes referencing Tokopedia's tech blog

After six months, one of the engineers she'd interacted with reached out: "Hey, we're hiring for a junior position. Want to apply? I'll make sure your resume gets looked at."

Rina got the interview and the offer. The champion had never even met her in person—but he'd seen her technical growth and work ethic through her online presence.

**Lesson:** Digital interactions can build real relationships if they're substantial and consistent.

### Dimas: The Open Source Path to Gojek

Dimas wanted to work at Gojek but didn't have the pedigree they typically looked for. He noticed that Gojek had open-sourced several internal tools.

He started contributing:
1. Fixed bugs and improved documentation
2. Added features that the team mentioned wanting
3. Helped other contributors in discussions

After eight months of contributions, he was invited to Gojek's contributor meetup. He met the team maintaining the project. Two months later, when they had a budget for a new role, they asked if he'd be interested.

Dimas never formally applied—he was recruited because he'd already proven he could contribute to their codebase.

**Lesson:** Contributing to a company's open-source projects is like a months-long interview where you demonstrate your skills.

### Arif: The Meetup Strategy

Arif attended the same monthly React meetup in Jakarta for a year. He didn't give talks—he just showed up, asked questions, and helped debug problems people shared.

One of the regulars worked at a startup that was scaling fast. When they needed to hire React developers quickly, he immediately thought of Arif: "This guy shows up every month, he knows his stuff, and everyone likes him."

Arif got an interview and an offer within two weeks.

**Lesson:** Consistency and being genuinely helpful in communities pays off—sometimes when you least expect it.

## The Long Game: Building a Network of Champions

The best approach to finding champions isn't a 90-day sprint—it's building a network over years.

### The Pay-It-Forward System

As you advance in your career, become a champion for others. This creates goodwill and strengthens your network.

**When you can help:**
- Junior engineers looking for their first role
- Career switchers breaking into tech
- People from underrepresented backgrounds
- International developers trying to break into Indonesian companies

### The Alumni Network Strategy

Stay connected with former colleagues, classmates, and bootcamp cohorts. As people disperse across the industry, you build a distributed network of potential champions.

### The Content Creation Advantage

Engineers who write blogs, give talks, or create educational content naturally attract people who want to work with them. Companies reach out to them.

This is the ultimate form of championing—where companies and champions find you instead of you having to find them.

## Action Plan: Your First Steps This Week

## Final Thoughts: Champions See Potential, Not Just Credentials

Here's what I want you to remember: champions don't advocate for perfect candidates. They advocate for people they believe in.

You don't need a degree from Stanford or five years at Facebook to find a champion. You need:
- Demonstrated skills and genuine interest in the work
- The patience to build real relationships
- The generosity to give before you ask
- The consistency to show up and deliver
- The authenticity to be yourself

The difference between sending 100 applications and getting zero interviews versus finding one champion and getting an offer isn't your qualifications—it's your approach.

Stop spraying resumes into the void. Start building relationships with people who can walk your resume to the decision-makers.

Your champion is out there. They might be speaking at next week's meetup. They might be the maintainer of an open-source project you use. They might be your classmate from university who just joined your dream company.

Go find them. Better yet, become the kind of person that champions naturally want to advocate for. The opportunities will follow.
