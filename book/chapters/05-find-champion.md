# Chapter 5: Find Your Champion

## The Power of Having an Inside Advocate

When I was trying to land my dream job at a top tech company, I learned one of the most valuable lessons of my career: having someone on the inside who believes in you is worth more than a perfect resume. This person—your champion—can be the difference between your application disappearing into a black hole and getting fast-tracked to an interview.

A champion is someone inside your target company who actively advocates for you. They're not just a referral source who clicks a button; they're someone who puts their reputation on the line to vouch for your abilities. They speak up for you in hiring meetings, answer questions about your candidacy, and help navigate you through the company's unique hiring process.

## Why Champions Matter More Than You Think

Let me share a hard truth about hiring in tech companies: most applications never get properly reviewed. At companies like Google, Microsoft, or even well-funded startups, thousands of applications pour in every week. Your resume might get 30 seconds of attention—if it even gets to a human.

But when you have a champion, everything changes. Here's what I've observed working at several tech companies:

**Direct Access to Decision Makers**: Your champion can directly reach hiring managers or team leads. They can say, "Hey, I know someone who would be perfect for this role." That conversation happens before your resume enters the system.

**Context Beyond the Resume**: A piece of paper can't capture your problem-solving approach, your learning velocity, or your ability to collaborate. Your champion can share these intangible qualities that actually predict job success.

**Internal Credibility Transfer**: Companies trust their employees' judgment. When a respected engineer says "you should hire this person," it carries significant weight. You inherit some of their credibility.

**Navigation Support**: Each company has its own culture, interview quirks, and unwritten rules. Your champion can guide you through these landmines, dramatically improving your chances.

I've seen candidates with average credentials get offers because they had strong champions, while brilliant engineers with perfect resumes got rejected because they had no one advocating for them.

## Identifying Potential Champions

Not everyone at your target company can be your champion. You need to be strategic. Here's how to identify good candidates:

### Look for These Qualities

**Active in the Community**: Engineers who write blogs, speak at conferences, contribute to open source, or are active on LinkedIn and Twitter. These people are naturally inclined to help others and are usually more approachable.

**Mid-to-Senior Level Engineers**: Junior engineers often don't have enough influence. Directors and VPs might be too busy. Senior engineers and engineering managers usually have the perfect combination of influence and accessibility.

**Similar Background or Interests**: Someone who graduated from a similar program, worked on similar technologies, or shares your interests in certain domains. Common ground makes initial connection easier.

**Demonstrated Mentorship**: Look for people who actively mentor others, speak about career development, or contribute to educational content. They're predisposed to help rising talent.

### Where to Find Them

In Indonesia and globally, here are the best places to connect with potential champions:

**Tech Communities and Meetups**: In Jakarta, Bandung, and other tech hubs, attend meetups focused on specific technologies (Python ID, Jakarta.js, Go Jakarta, etc.). Company engineers often present or attend these events.

**Open Source Projects**: Contribute to projects used by your target company. This demonstrates your skills and creates a natural connection point.

**LinkedIn and Professional Networks**: Research employees at your target company. Look for those who actively post content or engage with others' posts.

**Alumni Networks**: If you attended a university with a strong tech program, leverage alumni working at your target companies. The shared educational background is powerful.

**Tech Conferences**: Events like DevFest, Tech in Asia, and company-specific conferences (Google I/O Extended, Microsoft events) are goldmines for meeting company insiders.

**Online Communities**: Slack groups, Discord servers, and local tech forums where company engineers participate. For Indonesian developers, communities like Tech in Asia Indonesia, various LINE groups, or local coding bootcamp networks are valuable.

## Building Genuine Relationships

Here's where many people fail: they treat potential champions as a means to an end. That approach rarely works. You need to build genuine relationships. Let me share my framework:

### The Long Game Approach

**Start with Value, Not Asks**: Don't immediately ask for referrals. Instead, engage meaningfully with their content. If they write a blog post, leave a thoughtful comment. If they share open source work, contribute. Show genuine interest in their work.

**Share Your Journey**: Document your learning journey publicly. Write about problems you're solving, projects you're building, or concepts you're learning. When done authentically, this attracts like-minded professionals who might become champions.

**Attend Consistently**: Don't just show up once at a meetup. Become a regular face. This builds familiarity and trust naturally over time.

**Offer Help First**: Can you help them with something? Maybe they're organizing a community event and need volunteers. Maybe they're looking for beta testers for a side project. Contribute without expecting anything in return.

### The Initial Conversation

When you first reach out or meet someone, here's what works:

**Be Specific and Genuine**: Instead of "I'd love to work at your company," try "I read your blog post about distributed systems design. I'm working on a similar problem with my side project handling real-time data streaming. Would love to hear your thoughts on [specific technical question]."

**Respect Their Time**: Keep initial messages concise. Make it easy for them to respond. Don't write an essay about your life story in the first message.

**Find Common Ground**: Reference shared interests, mutual connections, or specific work of theirs that resonates with you. "I saw you also graduated from ITB's Computer Science program" or "I noticed you contributed to [specific open source project]."

**Be Professional But Personable**: You're building a relationship, not writing a cover letter. Let your personality show while maintaining professionalism.

### Nurturing the Relationship

The key is to stay on their radar without being annoying:

**Regular, Low-Pressure Touchpoints**: Share interesting articles related to their interests. Comment on their posts. Congratulate them on achievements. Keep interactions meaningful but brief.

**Demonstrate Growth**: Show that you're actively improving. Share your projects, learnings, or achievements periodically. Let them witness your progress.

**Seek Advice, Not Just Referrals**: Ask for their perspective on your career decisions, technical challenges, or learning path. People love giving advice and it positions you as someone serious about growth.

**Face-to-Face When Possible**: In Indonesia's relationship-driven culture, meeting in person creates stronger bonds. Suggest coffee chats (virtual or in-person) after you've had several positive online interactions.

## Making the Ask

After building a genuine relationship (this usually takes 2-6 months of consistent, meaningful interaction), you can make your move:

### Timing is Everything

Wait for the right moment:
- After they've seen your work and progress
- When you know they view you positively
- When there's an actual opening that matches your skills
- When you've provided value to them or their community

### How to Ask

**Be Direct But Gracious**: "I saw that [Company] is hiring for [specific role]. Based on our conversations about [specific topic], I think I could contribute significantly to [specific team/project]. Would you be comfortable referring me or introducing me to the hiring manager?"

**Make It Easy**: Provide everything they need:
- Your updated resume
- A brief paragraph about why you're a good fit
- Links to your best work (GitHub, portfolio, published articles)
- Specific role link or job ID

**Acknowledge the Favor**: "I understand this is a significant ask and you'd be putting your reputation on the line. I want you to be confident in recommending me."

**Accept No Gracefully**: If they decline or seem hesitant, respect it. Don't burn bridges. Sometimes timing isn't right, or they don't feel they know your work well enough. That's okay.

## Special Considerations for Indonesia

The Indonesian tech scene has unique dynamics:

**Leverage "Alumni" Networks**: Indonesian professionals place high value on alumni connections. If you share an alma mater with someone at your target company, mention it early and leverage it respectfully.

**Respect Hierarchies**: While tech culture is generally flat, Indonesian culture still respects hierarchy. When reaching out to senior leaders, be extra professional and deferential.

**Use Local Platforms**: Don't just rely on global platforms. Join Indonesian-specific tech communities on WhatsApp, LINE, or Telegram where locals are more active.

**English vs. Bahasa**: For international companies in Indonesia, demonstrate English proficiency. For local companies, showing cultural fit through Bahasa Indonesia can be valuable. Read the room.

**Government and Corporate Holidays**: Indonesian tech professionals are more active during certain times. Plan your outreach considering Ramadan, Lebaran, and major holidays.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Through my career and mentoring dozens of engineers, I've seen these mistakes repeatedly:

**Asking Too Soon**: Sending a connection request on LinkedIn and immediately asking for a referral is the fastest way to get ignored.

**Being Transactional**: Only reaching out when you need something. People can sense when they're being used.

**Mass Messaging**: Sending identical messages to multiple people at the same company. It's obvious and off-putting.

**Oversharing**: Writing paragraphs about your life story, struggles, or why you deserve a chance. Keep initial interactions focused and concise.

**Neglecting the Relationship Post-Referral**: If someone refers you and you get the job, stay in touch and show appreciation. If you don't get the job, update them and thank them regardless.

**Lying or Exaggerating**: Never misrepresent your skills or experience. Your champion's reputation is on the line, and dishonesty will backfire spectacularly.

## Multiple Champions Strategy

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Work on building relationships with multiple potential champions:

- **At different companies**: Cast a wider net for opportunities
- **At the same company**: Different perspectives and networks, but be careful not to seem like you're playing people against each other
- **At different levels**: Mix of engineers, managers, and senior leaders

This isn't about being manipulative—it's about building a genuine professional network that can support your career throughout your life.

## When You Become the Champion

One final thought: once you land your dream job, remember the people who helped you. Become a champion for others. This completes the cycle and enriches the entire tech community.

Answer messages from aspiring engineers. Provide thoughtful referrals for people whose work you believe in. Speak at universities and bootcamps. Write publicly about your experiences. The champion who helped you was once in your shoes, and someone helped them too.

## Action Steps

Here's what you should do after reading this chapter:

1. **Research**: Identify 3-5 target companies where you'd like to work
2. **Map People**: Find 5-10 potential champions at each company using the criteria discussed
3. **Engage**: Start following their content and engaging meaningfully (today!)
4. **Create**: Build something worth showing. Start a blog, contribute to open source, or build a portfolio project
5. **Connect**: Reach out to 2-3 people this week with genuine, thoughtful messages
6. **Be Patient**: Set a reminder for 3 months from now to evaluate your progress
7. **Give Back**: Help someone who's earlier in their journey than you

Remember, finding a champion isn't about gaming the system—it's about building genuine professional relationships that benefit everyone involved. The best champions are people who genuinely believe in your potential and want to see you succeed. Focus on becoming someone worth championing, and the right advocates will naturally emerge.

Your career is a long game. The relationships you build today will compound over decades. Start now, be authentic, and stay consistent. That dream job is closer than you think.
