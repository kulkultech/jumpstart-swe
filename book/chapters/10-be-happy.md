# Chapter 10: Don't Forget to Be Happy

I need to tell you something that nobody told me when I started: burnout is real, and it doesn't care how passionate you are about coding.

I learned this the hard way. Three years into my career, I was living the "dream" - working at a hot startup, shipping features every week, getting recognition from my team. I was also sleeping four hours a night, skipping meals, and hadn't seen my friends in months. I thought I was grinding. I was actually burning out.

One day, I sat down at my desk, opened my laptop, and just... couldn't. My hands were on the keyboard, but my brain refused to function. It wasn't writer's block or lack of motivation. It was emptiness. I had pushed so hard for so long that I had nothing left to give.

This chapter is about something that might sound soft or unimportant when you're starting your career, but trust me - it's the most important thing I'll tell you in this entire book: **you need to take care of yourself**. Not tomorrow, not when you've "made it," not when things slow down (they never do). Right now.

## The Tech Industry's Dirty Secret

Let's be honest about what we're walking into. The tech industry has a culture problem. We glorify hustle culture. We celebrate the founders who "sleep in the office" and the engineers who "crush it" with 80-hour weeks. We have free snacks, ping-pong tables, and "unlimited PTO" that nobody actually takes. We talk about "work hard, play hard" but mostly just work hard.

In Indonesia, this gets even more complicated. The tech scene here is competitive - really competitive. You're fighting for positions against hundreds of other engineers. Companies like Gojek, Tokopedia, and Bukalapak have their pick of talent. Startups expect you to wear multiple hats. The pressure to prove yourself, especially as a junior engineer, is intense.

Add to that the cultural expectations. In many Indonesian families, working long hours is seen as dedication. Taking time off might be viewed as laziness. Saying "no" to your manager feels disrespectful. And mental health? That's still a conversation many people aren't ready to have.

But here's what I've learned after years in this industry, both as an engineer and from countless conversations with HR teams: **the engineers who last and thrive are not the ones who work the hardest. They're the ones who work the smartest and take care of themselves**.

## Understanding Burnout

Before we talk about solutions, you need to understand what burnout actually is. It's not just being tired. It's not having a bad week. Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress.

Here are the real symptoms:

**Emotional exhaustion:**
- Feeling drained even after a full night's sleep
- Difficulty concentrating on even simple tasks
- Loss of motivation or interest in work you used to enjoy
- Irritability with teammates or loved ones
- Feeling detached or cynical about your job

**Physical symptoms:**
- Chronic fatigue that doesn't improve with rest
- Frequent headaches or muscle tension
- Changes in sleep patterns (insomnia or sleeping too much)
- Getting sick more often
- Changes in appetite

**Performance impact:**
- Decreased productivity despite working longer hours
- Making more mistakes than usual
- Difficulty making decisions
- Procrastinating on important tasks
- Missing deadlines you would normally meet

I'm describing these in detail because early-career engineers often don't recognize burnout until it's severe. You think you're just "having an off week" or "need to push through." But burnout doesn't work that way. It compounds. And if you ignore it long enough, it can derail your career - or worse, your health.

## The HR Perspective

Let me share something from the other side of the table. I've talked to dozens of HR leaders and engineering managers about this topic. Here's what they won't say in the job interview but will tell you privately:

**Companies know burnout is a problem.** The good ones care about it because burnt-out engineers make mistakes, create technical debt, and eventually quit. The bad ones care about it because turnover is expensive. Either way, they care.

But here's the catch: **they won't solve it for you**. They can provide resources - mental health benefits, flexible hours, employee assistance programs. But ultimately, setting boundaries and protecting your well-being is your responsibility.

HR leaders have told me their biggest frustration is watching talented engineers burn out unnecessarily. They see junior engineers working 12-hour days trying to prove themselves, not realizing that **sustainable performance beats heroic sprints every time**.

One HR director at a major Indonesian tech company put it this way: "We'd rather have an engineer who's consistently good for five years than one who's amazing for six months and then quits or becomes unproductive."

Think about that. The career-optimal move is not to work yourself to death. It's to pace yourself for the long run.

## Setting Boundaries That Don't Kill Your Career

Now the practical part. How do you take care of yourself without looking lazy or uncommitted? This is especially tricky in Indonesia, where face time and "dedication" are often valued.

### 1. Define Your Working Hours

This sounds basic, but most engineers don't do it. Decide when your workday starts and when it ends. Then actually stick to it.

Yes, there will be emergencies. Yes, there will be crunch times before releases. But these should be exceptions, not the norm. If you're constantly working late, something is wrong - with your workload, your efficiency, or your company's planning.

**Practical tip:** Set a daily alarm for 30 minutes before your "end time." Use that time to finish up, document what you're working on, and plan tomorrow. When the alarm goes off again, close your laptop.

### 2. Protect Your Weekends

This is non-negotiable. Your brain needs time to rest and recover. Working seven days a week doesn't make you more productive - it makes you less productive during the week.

I know the temptation. There's that feature you want to ship, that bug that's bothering you, or that side project you're excited about. But here's what successful senior engineers know: **consistency beats intensity**.

It's better to work effectively five days a week for years than to sprint seven days a week for months and burn out.

**Practical tip:** On Sunday evening, prepare for the week ahead. But don't actually work. Review your calendar, make a plan, but save the execution for Monday. This gives you the mental benefit of being prepared without stealing your recovery time.

### 3. Learn to Say No (Professionally)

This is probably the hardest skill for junior engineers. Your manager asks if you can take on an extra project. A senior engineer needs help with something. A recruiter wants to schedule a call during your lunch break.

Your instinct is to say yes to everything. That's how you prove yourself, right? Wrong. That's how you become overwhelmed and underdeliver on everything.

**How to say no without burning bridges:**

Instead of: "No, I can't do that."

Try: "I'd love to help with that. Right now I'm focused on [current priority]. Can we revisit this next week?" or "I can do that, but it means pushing back [other task]. What's more important?"

This shows you're willing but also that you're thoughtful about priorities and capacity. Good managers will respect this. If your manager consistently pushes back on reasonable boundary-setting, that's a red flag about the company culture.

### 4. Take Your Vacation Days

In Indonesia, many companies offer limited vacation days compared to global standards. Some offer 12 days a year, others offer more. Whatever you get, take them all.

I've seen so many engineers, especially early in their careers, hoard their vacation days. They think they're being dedicated. They're actually being foolish. Vacation days are part of your compensation. Not taking them is like working for free.

Moreover, companies with "unlimited PTO" often see employees taking less time off than companies with defined days. Don't fall into this trap.

**Practical tip:** At the start of each year, plan at least some of your vacation days. Book them in advance. Make them real. If you wait until you "have time," you'll never take them.

### 5. Establish a Shutdown Ritual

At the end of each workday, have a ritual that signals to your brain "work is over." This is especially important if you're working from home, where the boundaries between work and life blur.

My shutdown ritual:
1. Review what I accomplished today
2. Write down three priorities for tomorrow
3. Close all work-related tabs and apps
4. Put my laptop in a drawer (out of sight, out of mind)
5. Change out of my "work clothes" even if I'm at home

This might sound silly, but it works. Your brain needs clear signals about when work mode ends and personal mode begins.

## Taking Care of Your Mental Health

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: mental health in Indonesia's tech industry.

The conversation about mental health is slowly improving in Indonesia, but there's still stigma. Admitting you're struggling might feel like admitting weakness. Seeing a therapist might feel unnecessary or even shameful.

I'm telling you right now: **taking care of your mental health is not weakness. It's maintenance**. You maintain your car, your laptop, your codebase. Why wouldn't you maintain your mind?

### Warning Signs You Need Help

Pay attention to these:
- Persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or emptiness
- Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Significant changes in sleep or appetite
- Difficulty concentrating that doesn't improve with rest
- Thoughts of self-harm or that life isn't worth living

If you're experiencing several of these for more than two weeks, please talk to someone. A therapist, a counselor, your doctor - someone qualified to help.

### Resources for Indonesian Engineers

Mental health support in Indonesia is improving:

- **Halodoc, Alodokter, KlikDokter** - Online consultations with psychologists, more private and convenient
- **Into The Light Indonesia** - Mental health education and support
- **PULIH** - Psychological service institution
- **Employee Assistance Programs** - Many larger companies (Gojek, Tokopedia, etc.) offer confidential counseling services

Many companies now include mental health coverage in their insurance. Check your benefits. Use them. That's what they're there for.

### The Power of Talking

Sometimes, you don't need therapy. You just need to talk to someone who gets it.

Find your people. Other engineers who understand the pressure. Friends outside tech who can give you perspective. A mentor who's been through similar struggles. Online communities like Tech in Asia community or various Indonesian developer Discord servers.

One thing I've learned: when you open up about your struggles, you often find that others are dealing with similar things. The person who seems to have it all together might be struggling just as much as you are.

## Building Healthy Habits

Mental health isn't just about avoiding burnout. It's about building practices that make you resilient and happy.

### 1. Physical Exercise

I know, I know. You've heard this a thousand times. But it's true: exercise makes a massive difference to your mental health and cognitive performance.

You don't need to become a gym rat. You don't need to run marathons. Just move your body regularly.

Some options that work for Indonesian engineers:
- Morning walks around your neighborhood
- Joining a futsal group (great for networking too)
- Home workouts (there are tons of free YouTube channels)
- Swimming at a local pool
- Cycling (Jakarta and other cities have growing cycling communities)
- Joining a company sports team

**Aim for 30 minutes of movement, 3-4 times per week.** That's it. It's not about fitness goals. It's about keeping your body and brain functioning well.

### 2. Sleep is Non-Negotiable

I used to brag about functioning on 4-5 hours of sleep. I was an idiot.

Sleep deprivation:
- Decreases cognitive performance
- Impairs decision-making
- Weakens your immune system
- Increases errors and bugs in your code
- Makes you irritable and difficult to work with
- Accelerates burnout

You need 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Not because I say so, but because that's what research consistently shows for optimal cognitive function.

"But I can't sleep 8 hours and get everything done!" Yes, you can. What you can't do is function optimally on chronic sleep deprivation. You're not as productive as you think you are when you're tired.

**Practical tips for better sleep:**
- Keep a consistent sleep schedule (yes, even on weekends)
- No screens an hour before bed (I know, tough one)
- Make your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet
- No caffeine after 2 PM
- If you can't sleep, get up and do something boring until you're sleepy

### 3. Eat Actual Food

When you're busy, nutrition is often the first thing to go. You skip breakfast, eat whatever's fastest for lunch, and survive on coffee and snacks.

I'm not going to tell you to become a health food fanatic. But you need to eat real food regularly. Your brain needs fuel to function.

**Minimum viable nutrition for busy engineers:**
- Eat breakfast, even if it's just something simple
- Keep healthy snacks at your desk (nuts, fruit, etc.)
- Drink water throughout the day (not just coffee)
- Try to have at least one proper meal per day
- If you're ordering delivery (very common in Indonesian cities), choose options with vegetables and protein, not just carbs

When you're eating well, sleeping enough, and moving regularly, you'll be amazed at how much better you think and how much more resilient you are to stress.

## Maintaining Relationships

One of the first casualties of career obsession is your relationships. You stop seeing friends. You miss family gatherings. You're physically present but mentally absent.

This is a mistake. Your relationships are not a distraction from your career. They're what makes your career worth having.

### Stay Connected to Non-Tech People

It's easy to fall into the tech bubble where all your friends are engineers, all your conversations are about code, and you lose perspective on the rest of the world.

Maintain relationships with people outside tech. They'll remind you that there's more to life than shipping features and getting promoted. They'll give you perspective when you're stressed about a bug that nobody outside your company will ever care about.

### Make Time for Important People

Schedule it. I'm serious. If something is important to you, it goes on your calendar.

Weekly dinner with family? Calendar.
Monthly catch-up with close friends? Calendar.
Date night with your partner? Calendar.

Otherwise, it won't happen. Work will always expand to fill the available time.

### Be Present

When you're with people, actually be with them. Not checking Slack. Not thinking about that code review. Not planning tomorrow's sprint.

This is hard for engineers. Our brains are trained to solve problems, and we're always half-thinking about work. But the people in your life deserve your full attention.

**Practical tip:** When you're socializing, physically leave your laptop in another room and put your phone on silent. Not vibrate, silent. The world won't end if you're unreachable for two hours.

## Finding Meaning Beyond Work

Here's something nobody tells you: your career is not your identity. Your job title is not who you are. And finding your worth solely in your professional accomplishments is a recipe for unhappiness.

I've seen brilliant engineers who've achieved everything they thought they wanted - great job, good salary, respect from peers - and they're still miserable. Why? Because they put all their eggs in the career basket and neglected everything else that makes life meaningful.

### Cultivate Interests Outside Tech

Have hobbies that have nothing to do with coding. Play music. Do photography. Garden. Cook. Read fiction. Play sports. Create art. Whatever interests you.

These aren't distractions from your real work. They're what make you a well-rounded person and prevent you from burning out.

Some of the best engineers I know have rich lives outside of tech. They're interesting people with diverse experiences, and that actually makes them better engineers because they bring different perspectives to problem-solving.

### Contribute to Something Bigger

Whether it's volunteering, mentoring junior developers, contributing to open source, or working on projects that have social impact, find ways to contribute beyond your day job.

This gives you perspective. When you're stressed about a code review or a missed deadline, it helps to remember that you're also doing things that matter to others.

In Indonesia, there are growing opportunities for tech volunteering:
- Teaching coding at schools or communities
- Contributing to civic tech projects
- Mentoring through programs like Indonesia Mengajar for tech education
- Helping NGOs with their technology needs

## Recognizing When to Leave

Sometimes, the problem isn't you - it's your job. If you're doing everything right - setting boundaries, taking care of yourself, maintaining relationships - and you're still miserable, it might be time to consider a change.

### Red Flags of Toxic Work Environments

**Consistent overwork expectations:**
If 60-hour weeks are the norm, not the exception, and people who work normal hours are viewed as uncommitted, that's a problem.

**No respect for boundaries:**
If your manager regularly messages you at midnight or expects responses during vacation, and this is accepted as normal, that's toxic.

**Lack of support for mental health:**
If asking for help is seen as weakness, or if people are openly mocked for taking sick days or seeing therapists, get out.

**Perpetual crisis mode:**
Every deadline is an emergency. Every project is critical. Everything is always on fire. This is usually a sign of poor planning or management.

**High turnover:**
If people are constantly leaving, especially experienced engineers, pay attention. They know something you might not see yet.

### It's Okay to Quit

You don't owe your employer your health or happiness. If the job is destroying your well-being, it doesn't matter how prestigious the company is or how good it looks on your resume.

I know the job market in Indonesia can be competitive. I know there's pressure to stay in a "good" job. But no job is worth sacrificing your mental or physical health.

And here's what I've learned: when you leave a toxic situation, doors open that you didn't know existed. When you prioritize your well-being, you often end up in better situations, not worse ones.

## The Long Game

Let me tell you about two engineers I worked with early in my career.

Engineer A was incredibly talented and driven. Worked 70-hour weeks. Shipped features at an amazing pace. Got promoted quickly. Was praised constantly. After three years, burned out completely, left the industry, and now does something entirely different.

Engineer B was also talented but paced himself differently. Worked 40-45 hour weeks. Took vacation days. Had hobbies outside work. Seemed less "driven" to others. Fifteen years later, he's a principal engineer at a major tech company, still loves what he does, and has a family and life he enjoys.

Which career would you rather have?

The engineering career is a marathon, not a sprint. The person who's still coding with joy at 40 is not the one who burned brightest at 24. It's the one who learned to burn sustainably.

## Practical Action Steps

Okay, enough philosophy. Here's what you can do right now:

**This Week:**
1. Define your working hours and set alarms to enforce them
2. Schedule one social activity with friends or family
3. Check your company's benefits to see what mental health resources are available
4. Identify one hobby or interest you want to spend more time on

**This Month:**
1. Plan and book at least one vacation day
2. Start a physical activity (even just walking)
3. Have a conversation with your manager about workload if you're consistently overworked
4. Evaluate your sleep and make one change to improve it

**This Year:**
1. Establish sustainable work habits that you can maintain long-term
2. Build or strengthen relationships outside of work
3. Develop interests beyond coding
4. Regularly check in with yourself about your well-being and adjust as needed

## Key Takeaways

- Burnout is real, common in tech, and can derail your career if ignored
- Sustainable performance beats heroic sprints - companies know this even if they don't always act like it
- Setting boundaries is not laziness; it's professionalism and self-respect
- Your mental health is not a luxury; it's a requirement for a long, successful career
- Sleep, exercise, and nutrition aren't optional - they're the foundation of your cognitive performance
- Your relationships and life outside work aren't distractions - they're what makes your career meaningful
- If your job is destroying your health despite your best efforts, it's okay to leave
- The goal is not to work the hardest in your 20s - it's to still be happily coding in your 40s

## Final Thoughts

I started this chapter with my burnout story. Let me tell you how it ended.

After that day when I couldn't function, I made changes. I started setting boundaries. I began saying no. I prioritized sleep and exercise. I reconnected with friends and family. I found hobbies that had nothing to do with code.

Was I less productive? Actually, no. I was more productive because I was working smarter, not longer. Was my career hurt? Quite the opposite. I made better decisions, wrote better code, and became a better teammate because I was actually taking care of myself.

The best career advice I can give you is this: **don't forget to be happy**. Success without happiness is just impressive-looking misery. And you're too talented and have too much potential to waste your career being miserable.

Take care of yourself. It's not selfish - it's essential. Your future self will thank you.

Now close this book, go outside, and do something that makes you smile. The code will still be there tomorrow.
