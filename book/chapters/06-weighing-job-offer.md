# Chapter 6: Weighing Job Offers

Congratulations! You've received a job offer—or maybe even multiple offers. This is an exciting moment in your career, but it can also be overwhelming. The decision you make now will significantly impact your professional growth, financial well-being, and overall happiness for the next few years.

As a veteran software engineer who has reviewed hundreds of offers and an understanding of the HR perspective, I want to help you navigate this critical decision. This chapter will give you a comprehensive framework to evaluate and compare job opportunities beyond just the salary number.

## The Complete Picture: Beyond the Base Salary

Many early-career engineers make the mistake of focusing solely on the base salary when comparing offers. While compensation is important, it's just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Let's break down all the components you need to consider.

### 1. Total Compensation Package

#### Base Salary
Your base salary is your guaranteed annual income. This is the foundation of your compensation and what you'll use for most of your financial planning. In Indonesia, base salaries for software engineers can range from IDR 8-15 million/month for entry-level positions to IDR 20-50 million/month for mid-level engineers, with senior roles commanding even higher figures.

**From an HR perspective:** Companies structure base salaries based on market data, internal equity, and budget constraints. There's usually a salary band for each role, and HR has limited flexibility to go beyond that range.

**Negotiation tip:** If the base salary is below your expectations, ask about the salary band for the role and where the offer falls within that range. This gives you leverage to negotiate closer to the top of the band.

#### Equity and Stock Options
For startups and public companies, equity compensation can be a game-changer. This might come as:

- **Stock options (ISO/NSO):** The right to buy company shares at a predetermined price
- **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):** Shares granted outright that vest over time
- **Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP):** The ability to buy company stock at a discount

**Veteran perspective:** I've seen equity turn modest compensation packages into life-changing wealth—but I've also seen it become worthless. Ask these critical questions:

- What's the vesting schedule? (Common: 4 years with 1-year cliff)
- What percentage of the company do I own? (Ask for the fully-diluted cap table percentage)
- What's the current valuation and how has it grown?
- What's the liquidation preference? (Affects how much you get if the company is sold)
- When was the last funding round and what are the growth prospects?

**Reality check:** For early-stage startups, assume equity is worth zero until proven otherwise. Don't take a 30% salary cut for equity unless you truly believe in the company's mission and can afford the financial risk.

#### Bonuses and Performance Incentives
Many companies offer annual bonuses based on individual and company performance:

- **Target bonus:** Usually expressed as a percentage of base salary (10-30% is common)
- **Signing bonus:** One-time payment when you join (ranges from IDR 10-100 million depending on level)
- **Performance bonus:** Based on your yearly performance review
- **Profit sharing:** A percentage of company profits distributed to employees

**HR perspective:** Bonuses are variable compensation designed to align employee incentives with company goals. They're not guaranteed, so don't rely on them for essential expenses.

### 2. Benefits and Perks

The right benefits package can be worth millions of rupiah annually and significantly impact your quality of life.

#### Health Insurance
In Indonesia, companies must provide BPJS Kesehatan (government health insurance), but many also offer private insurance:

- **Coverage extent:** Inpatient, outpatient, dental, vision
- **Family coverage:** Does it include spouse and children?
- **Coverage limits:** Annual caps and co-payment requirements
- **Provider network:** Can you use your preferred hospitals?

**Cost perspective:** A good private health insurance plan for a family can cost IDR 15-30 million annually—a significant hidden benefit.

#### Retirement and Savings
- **BPJS Ketenagakerjaan:** Mandatory in Indonesia (company pays ~10% of salary)
- **Pension plans:** Some companies offer additional retirement savings
- **Employee Provident Fund:** Additional retirement contributions

#### Professional Development
- **Training budget:** Annual allowance for courses, conferences, certifications (IDR 10-50 million)
- **Conference attendance:** Fully paid trips to industry events
- **Certification support:** Company pays for AWS, GCP, or other professional certifications
- **Books and learning resources:** Unlimited access to learning platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or O'Reilly

**Veteran perspective:** This benefit is often undervalued by early-career engineers but is incredibly valuable. A company that invests in your growth is investing in your future earning potential. I've spent over $50,000 on my professional development over my career—companies that cover this are worth considering seriously.

#### Work-Life Balance Perks
- **Flexible working hours:** Can you start and end work when it suits you?
- **Remote work policy:** Fully remote, hybrid, or office-only?
- **Unlimited PTO:** Or a generous fixed vacation policy (12-20 days is common)
- **Parental leave:** Beyond the government-mandated leave
- **Mental health support:** Counseling services and wellness programs

#### Additional Perks
- **Transportation allowance:** IDR 1-3 million/month
- **Meal allowance:** IDR 1-2 million/month or free office meals
- **Phone and internet:** Company phone or monthly reimbursement
- **Relocation assistance:** If moving cities for the job
- **Co-working space budget:** For remote workers

### 3. Career Growth and Learning Opportunities

This is where many engineers underestimate long-term value. Your next role should make you more valuable two years from now.

#### Technical Growth
Ask yourself:
- **Technology stack:** Will I work with modern, in-demand technologies?
- **Codebase quality:** Am I joining a well-architected system or technical debt nightmare?
- **Scale and complexity:** Will I solve challenging problems at scale?
- **Mentorship:** Will I work with senior engineers who can teach me?
- **Code review culture:** Is there a strong culture of knowledge sharing?

**Veteran perspective:** Working with talented engineers is the fastest way to level up your skills. I learned more in one year working with exceptional engineers than in three years at a company with average talent. The right team is worth taking a 10-15% pay cut.

#### Career Trajectory
- **Promotion path:** What does the career ladder look like?
- **Time to promotion:** How long does it typically take to advance?
- **Role diversity:** Can you switch between teams/projects?
- **Leadership opportunities:** Can you lead projects or mentor others?

**Red flag:** If the company can't clearly explain the career path or hasn't promoted anyone internally in years, growth may be limited.

#### Industry and Domain Exposure
- **Industry relevance:** Is this industry growing in Indonesia? (e.g., fintech, e-commerce, edtech)
- **Domain expertise:** Will you become an expert in a valuable domain?
- **Resume value:** Will this company name open doors in the future?

### 4. Company Stability and Culture

You can have great compensation and benefits, but if the company culture is toxic or the business is failing, you'll be miserable or unemployed.

#### Financial Health
**Due diligence questions:**
- Is the company profitable, or does it have sufficient runway?
- When was the last funding round? How much was raised?
- What's the burn rate and path to profitability?
- Are there upcoming layoffs or restructuring?
- How is the company's revenue growing?

**HR perspective:** Public companies must disclose financial information, but startups are often opaque. It's reasonable to ask about runway and financial stability during the interview process. A company that's secretive about its finances may be hiding problems.

#### Company Culture
Culture fit is subjective but critical:

- **Work hours:** What are typical working hours? Is there an expectation to work evenings/weekends?
- **Meeting culture:** Are there endless meetings, or is there focus time?
- **Decision-making:** Top-down or collaborative?
- **Innovation vs. stability:** Does the company value experimentation or proven methods?
- **Diversity and inclusion:** Is the team diverse? Do people from different backgrounds feel welcome?

**How to assess culture:**
1. Talk to current employees (use LinkedIn to connect)
2. Read Glassdoor reviews (but take them with a grain of salt)
3. Ask about a typical work day during interviews
4. Observe the office environment and how people interact
5. Ask: "What do you like most and least about working here?"

#### Team and Manager Quality
Your direct manager has the biggest impact on your day-to-day experience:

- **Management style:** Micromanager or hands-off?
- **Technical competence:** Can your manager provide technical guidance?
- **Career support:** Will they advocate for your growth and promotions?
- **Communication:** Are expectations clear?

**Veteran perspective:** The saying is true: "People don't quit jobs, they quit managers." I've left high-paying roles because of poor management and stayed in lower-paying roles because of exceptional managers. In interviews, spend time talking to your potential manager and ask about their leadership philosophy.

#### Work Environment
- **Office location:** Commute time and traffic considerations (critical in Jakarta!)
- **Office quality:** Modern workspace or cramped conditions?
- **Equipment:** Will you have a good laptop, monitors, and ergonomic setup?
- **Team size:** Small intimate team or large department?

### 5. The Intangibles

Some factors are hard to quantify but matter greatly:

#### Brand and Reputation
- **Company recognition:** Will people be impressed when you say you work there?
- **Alumni network:** Where do people go after leaving? (Check LinkedIn)
- **Industry influence:** Is this company shaping the industry in Indonesia?

**Career perspective:** Working at a prestigious company like Google, Gojek, or Tokopedia provides a "halo effect" that benefits your entire career. Future employers will assume you're talented simply based on where you've worked.

#### Mission and Purpose
- **Do you care about what the company does?** You'll spend 40+ hours/week on this.
- **Social impact:** Is the company making a positive difference?
- **Personal alignment:** Do the company values match your own?

**Veteran perspective:** Earlier in your career, optimize for learning and compensation. Later, mission and purpose matter more. But if you find a role that pays well AND aligns with your values, that's the sweet spot.

#### Work-Life Balance
- **Average working hours:** 40 hours/week or 60+?
- **On-call expectations:** Will you be woken up at 3 AM for production issues?
- **Vacation culture:** Can you actually use your PTO, or is there pressure to be always available?
- **Burnout rate:** How long do people typically stay?

## The Comparison Framework

Now that you understand all the components, here's a systematic way to compare offers:

### Step 1: Create a Comparison Spreadsheet

Build a comprehensive spreadsheet with these categories:

**Financial Compensation:**
- Base salary (monthly/annual)
- Target bonus (calculate actual amount)
- Signing bonus (amortize over 2-4 years)
- Equity value (conservative estimate)
- **Total first-year compensation**
- **Total four-year compensation** (including vesting equity)

**Benefits (Annual Value):**
- Health insurance (market value)
- Professional development budget
- Transportation allowance
- Meal allowance
- Other perks (estimate value)
- **Total benefits value**

**Career Growth (1-10 rating):**
- Technical learning opportunity
- Mentorship quality
- Career advancement potential
- Resume value
- Industry relevance

**Work-Life Balance (1-10 rating):**
- Working hours
- Flexibility (remote, hours)
- Commute time
- Vacation policy
- Stress level (based on interviews)

**Company & Culture (1-10 rating):**
- Financial stability
- Culture fit
- Manager quality
- Team quality
- Office environment

### Step 2: Apply Personal Weighting

Not all factors are equally important to everyone. Assign weights based on your priorities:

**Example for early-career engineer:**
- Financial compensation: 40%
- Career growth: 35%
- Work-life balance: 15%
- Company & culture: 10%

**Example for experienced engineer with family:**
- Financial compensation: 30%
- Work-life balance: 30%
- Career growth: 20%
- Company & culture: 20%

Calculate a weighted score for each offer and compare.

### Step 3: The Gut Check

After all the analysis, ask yourself:
- Which offer am I most excited about?
- Which offer would I regret not taking?
- Where do I see myself thriving?
- Which choice will I be proud of in 5 years?

Sometimes your intuition knows what the spreadsheet doesn't capture.

## Negotiation: How to Improve an Offer

Most companies expect negotiation. Here's how to do it professionally:

### Before You Negotiate

1. **Get everything in writing:** Don't negotiate based on verbal offers
2. **Understand your leverage:** Do you have multiple offers? Are you in high demand?
3. **Know your market value:** Research salaries for your role/level (use Glassdoor, levels.fyi, local surveys)
4. **Identify your priorities:** What matters most—salary, equity, remote work, professional development?

### Negotiation Script

**Email template:**

```
Thank you for the offer to join [Company] as a [Role]. I'm very excited about the opportunity to [specific aspect you're excited about].

After reviewing the offer and considering my background and market rates for this role, I was hoping we could discuss adjusting the compensation. Specifically, [your request].

[Optional: Justification based on competing offers, market data, or unique skills]

I'm very interested in joining the team and I believe this adjustment would allow me to accept with full confidence. Are you able to accommodate this request?

Thank you for considering this, and I look forward to your response.
```

### What to Negotiate

**High success rate:**
- Signing bonus (easier than base salary increase)
- Stock options/RSUs (more options or better strike price)
- Start date (buy yourself more time)
- Professional development budget
- Remote work flexibility
- Vacation days
- Relocation assistance

**Medium success rate:**
- Base salary (within the band)
- Title (if you're borderline between levels)
- Benefits improvements

**Low success rate:**
- Changing the salary band
- Benefits structure (usually company-wide policies)

### HR Perspective on Negotiation

**What HR thinks when you negotiate:**
- ✅ "This candidate knows their worth" (if done professionally)
- ✅ "They're thoughtful and detail-oriented"
- ❌ "This person is difficult" (if done aggressively)
- ❌ "They'll be unhappy with the role" (if demands are unrealistic)

**HR tips:**
- We expect some negotiation and often hold back room in the initial offer
- Be specific and reasonable in your requests
- Justify requests with data, not emotions
- Don't negotiate multiple times—make all your requests at once
- Never make ultimatums unless you're willing to walk away

### When to Walk Away

Some offers aren't worth negotiating:
- Company culture feels toxic
- Salary is 30%+ below market rate with no equity upside
- Role doesn't match what was discussed in interviews
- Red flags about company stability or financial health
- Your gut tells you something is wrong

**Trust your instincts.** A bad job decision can set your career back years.

## Special Scenarios

### Multiple Offers: Creating a Bidding War

If you have multiple offers, you can leverage them ethically:

1. **Be honest:** "I have another offer with a deadline. I prefer your company, but the compensation is lower."
2. **Give deadlines:** "I need to respond to the other offer by [date]. Can you provide your best offer by then?"
3. **Don't lie:** Never invent competing offers. It's unethical and can backfire.

**Veteran perspective:** I've successfully used competing offers to increase compensation by 20-30%. The key is expressing genuine interest in both opportunities and letting companies compete on merit.

### Startup vs. Corporate Offers

This deserves special consideration because the offers can be dramatically different:

**Startup offer example:**
- Lower base salary (20-30% below market)
- Significant equity (0.25-1.0% of company)
- Huge learning opportunities
- High risk/high reward
- Intense work environment

**Corporate offer example:**
- Competitive base salary (market rate or above)
- Minimal equity or RSUs
- Structured career progression
- Lower risk/lower upside
- Better work-life balance

**How to decide:**
- **If you're early-career:** Startups offer faster learning but corporate offers stability
- **If you have financial obligations:** Corporate is safer
- **If you want to start a company someday:** Startup experience is invaluable
- **If you want work-life balance:** Corporate usually wins

### Counter-Offers from Your Current Company

Your current employer offers you a raise to stay after you get an external offer. Should you accept?

**Statistics show:** 50-80% of people who accept counter-offers leave within a year anyway.

**Why counter-offers often fail:**
- The underlying issues that made you want to leave remain
- Your loyalty is now questioned
- You've shown you were willing to leave
- The raise is often temporary (no future raises for a while)

**When to consider a counter-offer:**
- Compensation was the ONLY issue
- Your company makes substantial changes to address your concerns
- The external offer isn't significantly better
- You genuinely love your current role

**Veteran perspective:** I've accepted one counter-offer in my career, and I regretted it. The trust was broken, and I left six months later anyway. If you're getting external offers, it usually means it's time to move on.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Focusing Only on Salary
The engineer who takes the highest salary often isn't the happiest. Total compensation and growth opportunities matter more long-term.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring the Team
You'll spend more time with your team than your family. Team quality is critical.

### Mistake #3: Not Negotiating
Companies respect candidates who negotiate professionally. You're leaving money on the table if you accept the first offer.

### Mistake #4: Deciding Too Quickly
Take time to evaluate offers thoroughly. Most companies give you at least a week to decide.

### Mistake #5: Burning Bridges
Even if you reject an offer, do so professionally and leave the door open. The tech industry in Indonesia is small.

**Rejection email template:**

```
Thank you so much for the offer to join [Company] as a [Role]. After careful consideration, I've decided to pursue another opportunity that's a better fit for my current career goals.

I was very impressed by [specific positive aspects], and I hope our paths cross again in the future. Thank you for your time and consideration throughout this process.
```

6. **Trust your gut**—if something feels off, it probably is

Remember, you'll make many job decisions in your career. Each one is a learning opportunity. Even if you make the wrong choice, you'll gain valuable experience and know what to look for (or avoid) next time.

Now get out there and land that dream offer! And when you do, negotiate like the skilled professional you are.
