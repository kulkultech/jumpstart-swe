# Chapter 6: Weighing Job Offers

You've done the hard work. You networked, prepped, interviewed, and now you're holding a job offer—or maybe multiple offers. This should feel amazing, right?

But here's the truth: the moment you get an offer is when many engineers make career-defining mistakes. I've seen brilliant engineers accept offers they regretted within months. I've watched friends turn down life-changing opportunities because they optimized for the wrong things. And yes, I've made my own share of terrible decisions that cost me years of growth and hundreds of thousands in compensation.

The problem isn't that people don't think about job offers—it's that they think about them wrong. They focus on surface-level factors (salary, company brand, perks) while ignoring the deeper elements that actually determine whether a job will accelerate or stagnate their career.

This chapter will teach you how to evaluate job offers like a veteran who's been through the mistakes you're about to make. We'll go beyond the obvious and dive into the subtle factors that separate career-accelerating roles from career traps.

## The Framework: Beyond the Obvious

Most people evaluate offers using a simple mental calculation: "Company A pays more but Company B is more prestigious." This is amateur hour.

Professional offer evaluation requires a multi-dimensional framework. Here's mine, developed after a decade of career moves, mistakes, and mentoring dozens of engineers through their decisions.

### The Five Pillars of Offer Evaluation

Every job offer should be evaluated across five critical dimensions:

1. **Compensation** (but not just salary)
2. **Growth Trajectory** (your learning curve)
3. **People and Culture** (your daily environment)
4. **Company Stability and Stage** (risk/reward profile)
5. **Life Factors** (location, work-life balance, personal circumstances)

Let's break down each pillar in detail, because the devil—and the value—is in the details.

## Pillar 1: Understanding True Compensation

When most engineers compare offers, they look at base salary and stop there. This is leaving money on the table—sometimes a lot of money.

### Total Compensation Breakdown

**Base Salary** is just one component. Here's what actually matters:

**1. Base Salary**
- Your guaranteed annual compensation
- What shows up on your paycheck
- The foundation, but not the whole picture

**2. Performance Bonus**
- Annual or quarterly bonuses tied to performance
- In Indonesian tech companies like Tokopedia or Gojek, this typically ranges from 0-30% of base
- Ask: "What percentage of employees actually receive the target bonus?" Many companies set impossible targets

**3. Equity/Stock Options**
- For startups: stock options that may be worth nothing or millions
- For public companies: RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) with real, immediate value
- **Critical question for startups:** "What's the current valuation? How much has been raised? What percentage of the company do these options represent?"

**4. Signing Bonus**
- One-time payment when you join
- Often negotiable even when other components aren't
- Sometimes structured as "make whole" to compensate for bonuses you're leaving behind

**5. Benefits**
- Health insurance (for you and family?)
- Retirement/pension contributions (BPJS in Indonesia)
- Professional development budget
- Equipment allowance (laptop, monitor, peripherals)
- Internet/phone reimbursement (especially for remote work)
- Transportation allowance or company vehicle
- Meal allowances

**6. Less Obvious Compensation**
- Remote work flexibility (saves commute time and costs)
- Flexible hours (valuable if you're a night owl or early bird)
- Unlimited PTO (though beware—sometimes this means less time off)
- Sabbatical opportunities
- Relocation assistance
- Immigration support (critical if you're considering international opportunities)

### The Total Comp Calculator

Let me show you how to calculate true total compensation with a real example:

**Offer A: Indonesian Startup**
- Base: Rp 180M/year
- Bonus: 20% target (assume 15% actual based on company track record): Rp 27M
- Stock options: 0.1% of company (valued at current round at Rp 50M over 4 years): Rp 12.5M
- Benefits: Basic health insurance (Rp 5M value)
- Remote work: 3 days/week (saves Rp 5M in commute/food)

**Total Year 1 Value:** Rp 180M + Rp 27M + Rp 12.5M + Rp 5M + Rp 5M = **Rp 229.5M**

**Offer B: Established Tech Company**
- Base: Rp 200M/year
- Bonus: 15% target (assume 12% actual): Rp 24M
- No equity
- Benefits: Comprehensive health + life insurance (Rp 10M value)
- Professional development: Rp 10M/year
- Full remote: (saves Rp 10M in commute/food)

**Total Year 1 Value:** Rp 200M + Rp 24M + Rp 0 + Rp 10M + Rp 10M + Rp 10M = **Rp 254M**

Suddenly, the gap isn't 20M—it's 24.5M, and that doesn't account for the startup equity upside (or downside).

### The Equity Deep Dive

Equity is where engineers make the biggest mistakes, especially at startups. Let me break it down.

**For Startup Options:**

Ask these specific questions:
1. "How many total shares are outstanding?" (This tells you what your percentage actually means)
2. "What's the current share price and what was it at the last funding round?"
3. "What's the vesting schedule?" (Typically 4 years with 1-year cliff)
4. "What's the strike price?" (What you pay to exercise options)
5. "What's the post-termination exercise window?" (Usually 90 days—a trap if you can't afford to exercise)
6. "What type of stock options are these—ISOs or NSOs?" (Different tax implications)

**The Startup Equity Reality Check:**

Most startup equity is worth zero. That's not cynicism—it's statistics. About 90% of startups fail. Of those that succeed, most exit at valuations that make early employees' options worth less than you'd think.

**Example:** You get 0.1% of a company that exits for $100 million (a huge success). That's $100,000 before taxes and before dilution from new funding rounds. If you've been there 4 years, that's an extra $25,000/year. Nice, but not life-changing.

However, that 0.1% in a unicorn exit ($1 billion+) is $1 million. Now we're talking.

**My rule:** Value startup equity at 20% of its "best case" value for decision-making purposes. If the best-case scenario would give you $100K, mentally treat it as worth $20K. If you're positively surprised, great. If not, you didn't make a decision based on fantasy.

**For Public Company RSUs:**

These are much simpler—they're real money on a vesting schedule. If Google offers you $100K in RSUs vesting over 4 years, that's $25K/year in real value (subject to stock price changes, but it's liquid).

### The Indonesian Context: Salary Expectations

Let's be real about Indonesian tech salary ranges (approximate figures for 2024, can vary significantly based on specific skills, company stage, and market conditions):

**Fresh Graduate (0-1 year):**
- Startup: Rp 8M - 15M/month
- Established tech: Rp 12M - 20M/month
- Unicorn (Gojek, Tokopedia): Rp 15M - 25M/month
- International company (Singapore regional): Rp 20M - 35M/month

**Mid-Level (2-4 years):**
- Startup: Rp 15M - 30M/month
- Established tech: Rp 20M - 40M/month
- Unicorn: Rp 30M - 60M/month
- International company: Rp 40M - 80M/month

**Senior (5-7 years):**
- Startup: Rp 30M - 60M/month
- Established tech: Rp 40M - 80M/month
- Unicorn: Rp 60M - 120M/month
- International company: Rp 80M - 200M/month

These are ballpark ranges. Specializations (ML, infrastructure, security) often command 20-40% premiums.

**Remote International Opportunities:**
Working for US/European companies remotely can pay $60K-150K+ USD annually (Rp 900M-2.25B+) even at mid-level, though competition is fierce and you need strong English skills.

### Negotiation: The Art of Getting More

Here's a secret: almost every offer has room for negotiation. Companies expect it. Not negotiating is leaving money on the table.

**What's Almost Always Negotiable:**
- Base salary (10-20% range typically)
- Signing bonus (easiest to negotiate)
- Start date
- Remote work arrangements
- Professional development budget
- Equity amount (for startups)
- Job title/level (matters for future opportunities)

**What's Usually Not Negotiable:**
- Bonus percentage structure
- Benefits package (it's standardized)
- Core company policies

**The Negotiation Script That Works:**

"Thank you so much for the offer. I'm really excited about [specific thing about the role/company]. I've done market research, and based on my [specific skills/experience], I was expecting compensation closer to [specific number]. Is there flexibility in the offer?"

**Then shut up and wait.** Seriously. Don't fill the silence. Let them respond.

**If They Can't Move on Salary:**

"I understand the salary constraint. Would there be flexibility in [signing bonus/equity/start date/remote work]?"

**The Competing Offer Leverage:**

If you have multiple offers, use them ethically:

"I have another offer at [Company] for [amount]. I'm more excited about your opportunity because of [specific, genuine reason], but the compensation gap is significant. Is there any way to bridge that gap?"

**Indonesian Cultural Note:**

Negotiation can feel uncomfortable in Indonesian culture where directness is sometimes seen as aggressive. Frame negotiation as seeking to understand and find mutual benefit, not as making demands. Use softening language: "I was hoping we could discuss..." instead of "I need you to..."

## Pillar 2: Growth Trajectory—Your Learning Curve

Compensation is important, but early in your career, your learning rate matters more than your earning rate. The skills you gain in your next role will determine your compensation for the decade after.

### The Learning Velocity Test

Ask yourself: "How steep will my learning curve be at this company?"

**Indicators of High Learning Velocity:**

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Modern, industry-standard technologies
   - Technologies you want to learn
   - Technologies that are marketable (what's on job postings for roles you want in 2-3 years)

2. **Engineering Quality Standards**
   - Code review culture
   - Testing practices
   - Documentation standards
   - CI/CD maturity
   - Production quality expectations

3. **Mentor Access**
   - Senior engineers you'll work with directly
   - Engineering leaders who are accessible
   - People you can learn from

4. **Problem Complexity**
   - Challenging technical problems
   - Scale (users, data, traffic)
   - Business impact of your work

5. **Autonomy vs. Structure**
   - Early career: You might want more structure
   - Mid-career: You might want more autonomy
   - Match it to your growth stage

### Questions to Ask During Interviews

These questions reveal whether a company will accelerate your growth:

**About the Team:**
- "What does the code review process look like?"
- "How do you handle knowledge sharing—tech talks, documentation, pair programming?"
- "What's the experience distribution of the team?" (Want a mix of junior and senior)
- "Who would I be working most closely with?"

**About the Work:**
- "What technologies will I be working with day-to-day?"
- "What's the most challenging technical problem the team is currently facing?"
- "What does a typical week look like for someone in this role?"
- "How does the team balance feature development with technical debt?"

**About Development:**
- "What does career progression look like here?"
- "Is there a professional development budget?"
- "How does the company support learning—conferences, courses, certifications?"
- "What's the promotion timeline for someone performing well?"

### The Mentorship Factor

This deserves special attention. Having good mentors can 5x your growth rate.

**Red flag:** Team has no senior engineers, or senior engineers are too busy to mentor.

**Green flag:** During interviews, senior engineers talk about mentoring as part of their role. You meet your potential mentor and get good vibes.

Having a senior engineer who dedicates time to pair programming and mentorship can accelerate your learning dramatically—turning what might take a year of solo struggling into six months of focused growth.

### The Career Ladder Clarity

Some companies have clear career ladders (Junior → Mid → Senior → Staff → Principal) with defined expectations at each level. Others are ambiguous.

**Why this matters:** Clear ladders mean you know what "good" looks like and what you need to do to advance. Ambiguous systems mean you're guessing, and often, the loudest people get promoted while quiet high-performers get overlooked.

**Ask:** "Can you show me the engineering career ladder? What would I need to demonstrate to reach the next level?"

### The Brand Value

Let's be honest: having Gojek, Tokopedia, Google, or Facebook on your resume opens doors. But brand value has diminishing returns.

**Early career (0-3 years):** Brand matters a lot. It signals quality to future employers.

**Mid career (3-7 years):** Brand matters less than specific skills and impact.

**Senior (7+ years):** Brand barely matters. Your track record and network matter more.

**The trade-off:** Sometimes a lesser-known company offers better growth but less brand value. Which matters more to you right now?

### The Indonesian Unicorn Premium

In Indonesia, there's a prestige hierarchy:

**Tier 1 (Highest Brand Value):**
- Gojek
- Tokopedia (now GoTo)
- Traveloka
- Bukalapak

**Tier 2:**
- Xendit, Flip, Dana (fintech leaders)
- Tiket.com, PegiPegi
- Shopee Indonesia
- Regional offices: Sea Group, Grab

**Tier 3:**
- Growing startups with solid funding
- Enterprise companies (banks, telecoms) with digital arms

Having a Tier 1 company on your resume significantly eases your next job search, especially within Indonesia. But it's not everything—I know engineers from unknown startups who outgrew their unicorn-company peers because they had more ownership and challenge.

## Pillar 3: People and Culture—Your Daily Reality

You'll spend 40-60 hours per week with these people in this environment. Culture fit matters more than most engineers realize.

### Evaluating Culture During Interviews

**Green Flags:**

1. **People seem happy**
   - Genuine smiles and energy
   - People speak positively about their teammates
   - Low defensiveness when you ask about challenges

2. **Psychological safety**
   - Interviewers admit to not knowing things
   - They discuss failures openly
   - They're curious about your ideas, not just testing you

3. **Reasonable work-life balance**
   - People have lives outside work (they mention hobbies, families)
   - No glorification of overwork
   - Realistic expectations about hours

4. **Diversity of thought**
   - Different perspectives represented
   - Healthy disagreement in how they discuss problems
   - Not everyone is a clone of each other

5. **Mission-driven, not just profit-driven**
   - People care about the product and users
   - There's a sense of purpose beyond making money

**Red Flags:**

1. **High turnover**
   - Check LinkedIn—if most people leave within 1-2 years, that's a signal
   - Ask directly: "What's the average tenure on the team?"

2. **Overwork culture**
   - Interviewers respond to emails at 11 PM during your interview process
   - They brag about working weekends
   - Phrases like "we work hard and play hard" (usually means work hard, no play)

3. **Toxic dynamics**
   - Interviewers speak negatively about other teams
   - Politics and backstabbing are hinted at
   - Blame culture (always someone else's fault)

4. **Lack of diversity**
   - Everyone looks, talks, and thinks the same
   - No women or underrepresented groups in senior roles (signals deeper issues)

5. **Dishonesty or evasiveness**
   - Questions about challenges get generic PR answers
   - Won't let you talk to potential teammates informally
   - Inconsistent information from different interviewers

### The Manager Make-or-Break Factor

Your manager will have more impact on your experience than any other factor. A great manager at a mediocre company beats a terrible manager at a great company every time.

**During interviews, ask to speak with your potential manager. Then ask:**

- "What's your management philosophy?"
- "How do you support your team's growth?"
- "Tell me about a time you helped someone on your team through a challenge."
- "What feedback have you received about your management style?"
- "How often do you do 1-on-1s?"

**Trust your gut.** If something feels off about the person who'd be your manager, listen to that instinct.

**Indonesian Context: Hierarchical Culture**

Indonesian workplaces often have more hierarchical dynamics than Western tech companies. This isn't inherently bad, but understand what you're signing up for:

- More formal communication styles
- Respect for seniority and position
- Less direct feedback culture
- Decisions flow top-down more often

If you thrive in flat, egalitarian environments, seek out companies with strong engineering cultures that push back against traditional hierarchy (Gojek and Tokopedia have worked to build more Western tech culture).

### The Remote Work Factor

Post-pandemic, remote work is now table stakes for many engineers. But "remote-friendly" varies wildly.

**Questions to ask:**

- "What percentage of the engineering team is remote?"
- "Are there core hours when everyone needs to be online?"
- "How do you handle time zone differences?" (If working for international companies)
- "What's the policy on working from different cities/countries?"
- "Do remote employees have equal access to opportunities and promotion?"

**Beware "remote asterisk"** companies that say they're remote but clearly favor office workers for promotions and interesting projects.

### The Work-Life Balance Reality

Every company claims good work-life balance. Here's how to verify:

**During interviews:**
- "What time did you start today, and what time do you expect to finish?"
- "When's the last time you worked on a weekend? What was the reason?"
- "How does the team handle on-call rotations?" (If applicable)
- "What's the PTO policy, and do people actually use it?"

**Check Glassdoor reviews** specifically for work-life balance comments. Patterns emerge.

**Indonesian Startup Reality:** Many Indonesian startups, especially during growth phases, have intense work cultures. This isn't necessarily bad—it can be exhilarating—but know what you're signing up for. If you have family commitments, be realistic about what you can sustain.

## Pillar 4: Company Stability and Stage—Risk/Reward Profile

Different company stages offer different risk/reward profiles. Neither is better—but you need to match it to your situation and risk tolerance.

### The Startup Stage Spectrum

**Pre-Seed / Seed Stage (Team: 5-20, Funding: <$2M)**

**Pros:**
- Massive equity upside if successful
- Huge ownership and impact
- Wear many hats, learn diverse skills
- Close to founders, shape culture

**Cons:**
- High failure risk (>90%)
- Lower compensation
- Chaos and constant change
- Limited mentorship/structure
- May fold in 6-18 months

**Best for:** Risk-tolerant engineers who want maximum ownership, don't have dependents, and want to learn by doing.

**Series A/B (Team: 20-100, Funding: $2M-$20M)**

**Pros:**
- Product-market fit found (probably)
- Rapid growth, exciting momentum
- Still meaningful equity
- Some structure emerging
- Learning opportunities

**Cons:**
- Still risky (50-70% failure rate)
- Scaling chaos
- Processes aren't mature yet
- Compensation below market
- Intense work culture often required

**Best for:** Engineers who want startup experience with slightly lower risk, care about learning, and can handle ambiguity.

**Series C/D (Team: 100-500, Funding: $20M-$100M+)**

**Pros:**
- Clear product-market fit
- Resources to build properly
- Better compensation
- More stability
- Career growth paths emerging
- Still equity upside potential

**Cons:**
- Less individual impact
- More politics emerging
- Equity less valuable (diluted, high valuation)
- Slower decision-making

**Best for:** Engineers who want balance between startup energy and stability.

**Example:** Indonesian companies at this stage include Xendit, Flip, Ula, Sayurbox (though stages change as they raise more funding).

**Unicorn/Pre-IPO (Team: 500-5000+, Funding: $100M+, Valuation: $1B+)**

**Pros:**
- Strong compensation
- Stability and resources
- Impressive brand name
- Work on scale problems
- Clear career paths
- Equity might actually pay off

**Cons:**
- More corporate, less startup feel
- Politics and bureaucracy
- Your impact feels smaller
- Equity upside limited (already high valuation)
- Slower innovation

**Best for:** Engineers who want stability, strong compensation, brand name, and to work on scale challenges.

**Example:** Gojek, Tokopedia (GoTo), Bukalapak, Traveloka in Indonesia.

### Public Company / Enterprise

**Pros:**
- High stability (unlikely to fold)
- Excellent compensation and benefits
- Established processes and mentorship
- RSUs are real money
- Work-life balance typically better
- Career progression clear

**Cons:**
- Slow decision-making
- Bureaucracy and politics
- Less innovation
- Smaller impact per engineer
- Can be boring for some
- Less equity upside

**Best for:** Engineers who value stability, have families, want predictability, or are tired of startup chaos.

**Example in Indonesia:** Regional offices of Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, plus local enterprises like Telkom, BCA, or Mandiri digital arms.

### The Funding Runway Question

This is critical for any startup. Ask:

**"What's the current funding runway?"** (How long until money runs out?)

**Safe answer:** 18-24+ months

**Concerning answer:** 6-12 months

**Run away answer:** Less than 6 months

A company with low runway will face existential pressure. That means:
- Intense work to hit metrics for next fundraise
- Potential layoffs
- Pivot risks
- Your equity could vaporize

**Exception:** If you're joining specifically to help save/turn around a struggling company, and you know that's what you're signing up for.

### The Market Position Question

Is this company a leader, a fast follower, or a struggling player?

**Market leaders** (Gojek in super-app, Tokopedia in e-commerce):
- More resources
- Easier recruiting
- More stability
- But potentially slower innovation

**Fast followers** (competing well but not #1):
- Scrappy and motivated
- Good learning environment
- Risk of getting crushed by leader
- May get acquired (good or bad depending on terms)

**Struggling players** (#4+ in a consolidating market):
- High risk
- Can be learning opportunity if you join to fix things
- Often have morale problems
- May shut down suddenly

**Research the market:** Before accepting any startup offer, understand their competitive position. Are they gaining or losing ground?

## Pillar 5: Life Factors—Personal Circumstances Matter

Technical factors aside, personal circumstances matter. A perfect-on-paper job that ruins your life isn't worth it.

### Location and Commute

**Jakarta reality:** Traffic is brutal. A job with a 2-hour each-way commute is stealing 4 hours of your life daily. That's 20 hours per week—equivalent to working a part-time job in your car.

**Calculate the cost:**
- Time lost
- Transportation costs
- Stress and health impact
- Lost time with family/hobbies

A job paying Rp 20M/month with a 2-hour commute might be worse than one paying Rp 18M/month with 30-minute commute or remote work.

**Remote work changes the game.** If you can work remotely, you can live in Bandung, Yogyakarta, or Bali while earning Jakarta salaries. This arbitrage can dramatically improve your quality of life.

### Family Considerations

**If you're single with no dependents:**
- You can take more risks
- Equity-heavy comp makes sense
- You can work longer hours if needed
- You can relocate easily

**If you have family (spouse, kids, aging parents):**
- Stability matters more
- Health insurance quality matters more
- Predictable hours matter more
- Relocation is harder
- School quality matters (if kids)

**Be honest with yourself:** That exciting startup requiring 60-hour weeks might not work if you have a newborn at home. There's no shame in choosing stability.

### Career Stage Alignment

Your career stage should influence your decision:

**First job (0-1 year experience):**
- Prioritize learning and mentorship
- Brand name helps
- Compensation is secondary
- Get your foundation right

**Early career (1-3 years):**
- Balance learning with compensation
- Start building specialized skills
- Brand still matters
- Take calculated risks

**Mid-career (3-7 years):**
- Compensation and title matter more
- Seek leadership opportunities
- Look for where you can make significant impact
- Balance risk/reward carefully

**Senior (7+ years):**
- Compensation, equity, title are top priorities
- Look for leadership/principal engineer paths
- You've proven yourself; now maximize value
- Consider founding or joining as early employee if you want upside

### Personal Goals and Timeline

What do you want in 2-5 years?

**If you want to start your own company:**
- Join a startup to learn how they work
- Equity is less important (you'll build your own)
- Learning and network matter most

**If you want to maximize earnings:**
- Join public companies or late-stage startups
- Focus on total comp
- Consider remote international opportunities

**If you want work-life balance:**
- Avoid early-stage startups
- Choose companies with proven healthy culture
- Remote work is valuable

**If you want to become a technical leader:**
- Look for senior engineer role models
- Choose companies that promote from within
- Seek mentorship and leadership opportunities

Your decision should align with your goals, not just maximize immediate compensation.

## The Decision Framework: Putting It All Together

You've analyzed all five pillars. Now what? Here's my systematic decision-making framework.

### Step 1: The Deal-Breaker Check

Eliminate any offers that fail on absolute deal-breakers:

**Common deal-breakers:**
- Compensation below your minimum acceptable
- Location/commute you can't tolerate
- Manager you got bad vibes from
- Company likely to fold soon
- Role that doesn't advance your goals
- Culture that's clearly toxic

Be ruthless here. Don't rationalize away genuine concerns.

### Step 2: The Scoring Exercise

For remaining offers, score each on the five pillars (1-10 scale):

1. Compensation (weight: varies by your situation)
2. Growth trajectory (weight: high early career, moderate mid-career)
3. People & culture (weight: always high)
4. Company stability (weight: varies by risk tolerance)
5. Life factors (weight: varies by personal situation)

Apply weights based on your priorities:

**Example weights for early-career engineer with no dependents:**
- Compensation: 2x
- Growth: 3x
- Culture: 3x
- Stability: 1x
- Life factors: 1x

**Example weights for mid-career engineer with family:**
- Compensation: 3x
- Growth: 2x
- Culture: 3x
- Stability: 3x
- Life factors: 3x

Calculate weighted scores for each offer. The highest score might surprise you.

### Step 3: The Gut Check

Numbers don't capture everything. Ask yourself:

- **Which offer excites you most when you think about Monday morning?**
- **Which company's mission do you care about?**
- **Where do you see yourself being happy in 6 months?**
- **Which offer would you be proud to tell friends about?**

If your gut strongly contradicts your scored rankings, there's probably an important factor you didn't capture in your analysis.

### Step 4: The Regret Minimization Framework

Jeff Bezos famously used this when deciding to start Amazon.

**Imagine yourself at age 60, looking back. Which decision would you regret NOT taking?**

- Would you regret taking the safer, higher-paying job?
- Or would you regret not taking the risky startup that could've been huge?
- Would you regret not prioritizing family time?
- Or would you regret not maximizing your career growth?

This question cuts through the noise and gets to what really matters to you.

### Step 5: The Advice Collection

Talk to people you trust:

**Mentors** - People who know you and your goals
**Friends at those companies** - Get insider perspectives
**Family** - Especially if decision affects them
**Strangers** - Sometimes unbiased outsiders see clearly

But remember: it's your life, not theirs. Listen to advice, but make your own decision.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Let me save you from mistakes I've seen repeatedly:

### Mistake #1: Chasing Brand Names Without Considering Growth

"I got into Google! I have to accept!"

If Google's offer means you'll be a tiny cog in a massive machine with no mentorship and boring work, while Startup X offers mentorship from senior engineers and challenging problems, maybe Google isn't right for you *right now*.

Brand names help, but they're not everything. I know engineers who turned down FAANG offers for startups and 5 years later were more skilled, better compensated, and happier.

### Mistake #2: Optimizing Only for Salary

Your first $20M/month raise feels huge. Your second $20M/month raise feels less exciting. Salary has diminishing returns on happiness.

Meanwhile, hating your job every day for an extra $5M/month is a terrible trade-off. Don't chase money while sacrificing learning, culture, or work-life balance unless you're explicitly doing it for a defined period (like paying off debt).

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Red Flags Because You're Excited

You notice concerning signs during interviews—high turnover, evasive answers, overwork culture hints—but you're excited about the brand/compensation and rationalize them away.

**Don't.**

Red flags rarely disappear. They usually get worse. If your gut says something's off, listen.

### Mistake #4: Accepting Too Fast or Dragging Too Long

**Too fast:** You get an offer and accept immediately without negotiating or considering other options. You might leave money on the table and miss better opportunities.

**Too long:** You string companies along for months while you keep interviewing. You might lose offers, frustrate hiring managers, and damage your reputation.

**The right balance:** Thank them for the offer, say you need a few days to a week to consider it thoughtfully, then make a decision in that timeframe. If you're waiting on other companies, be honest: "I'm in final rounds with another company and will have their decision by [date]. Could I get back to you by then?"

### Mistake #5: Not Negotiating Because You Fear Losing the Offer

This is especially common among Indonesian engineers due to cultural conditioning around gratitude and not appearing greedy.

**Reality:** Companies almost never rescind offers because you negotiated professionally. They expect it. You'll only lose the offer if you're obnoxious or unreasonable.

**Worst case** if you negotiate: They say no, and you accept the original offer. You're no worse off.

**Best case:** You get $20M-50M more per year, better equity, or improved terms.

Always negotiate.

### Mistake #6: Making Decisions Based on Irrelevant Factors

"The office has free snacks and a game room!"

Cool. Does that help your career in 2 years? Probably not.

Don't be swayed by perks that don't matter. Focus on what advances your goals.

### Mistake #7: Comparing Offers Without Adjusting for Context

"Company A pays $80K USD remote, Company B pays Rp 1.2B annually."

At first glance, these seem similar (both roughly Rp 1.2B annually at $1=Rp 15K exchange rate). But:

- $80K remote from US company often has better benefits, equity, and career growth
- Living costs in Jakarta vs. working remote from Bandung are different
- Tax implications differ
- Career implications differ (international experience vs. local experience)

Compare apples to apples, adjusting for all contextual factors.

## Special Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Competitive Offers

You have 2-3 strong offers and genuinely can't decide.

**Strategy:**
1. Use one to negotiate the other(s) ethically
2. Revisit your personal goals—which aligns best?
3. If still tied, pick the one with the best manager/team
4. Flip a coin—seriously. If you're disappointed by the result, you know which you really wanted

**Remember:** There's no perfect choice. Either option will work out if you commit to making it work.

### Scenario 2: Dream Company vs. Better Offer

Your dream company (maybe Gojek or Google) offers less money than your safety company.

**Questions to ask:**
- **How much less?** If it's 10-15%, might be worth it for the dream company experience. If it's 40%+, think hard.
- **Why is it your dream company?** Brand? Learning? Mission? Are those reasons still valid?
- **What's your financial situation?** Can you afford the lower pay?
- **What's your career stage?** Early career—chase the dream. Mid-career with family—maybe choose the money.

**My take:** Early in your career, optimize for learning and brand within reason. Later, optimize for compensation and impact.

### Scenario 3: Startup Equity vs. Established Company Cash

Classic dilemma: Startup offers Rp 150M + significant equity. Established company offers Rp 250M + no equity.

**Analysis:**
- Value startup equity realistically (20% of best case)
- Consider your runway (emergency fund, debt, dependents)
- Consider your risk tolerance
- Consider the startup's stage and funding

**General guidance:**
- **Can afford risk:** Go startup if you believe in it
- **Can't afford risk:** Go established company
- **On the fence:** Go with whichever excites you more

### Scenario 4: Switching Companies vs. Internal Transfer

You have an external offer that's better than your current role, but your company offers an internal transfer to a better team.

**Consider:**
- Internal transfer might be faster (no interview process) and safer
- But external offer might pay more and refresh your perspective
- Company loyalty matters less than you think
- Don't stay just because it's comfortable

**My take:** If the external offer is significantly better (30%+ comp, better growth trajectory), take it. If it's marginal, maybe try the internal transfer first.

### Scenario 5: International Remote vs. Local Company

US/European company offers full remote at $80-120K USD. Indonesian company offers Rp 300-600M/year on-site or hybrid.

**Factors to weigh:**
- Currency risk (rupiah depreciation over time)
- Time zone challenges (do you want to work US or EU hours from Indonesia?)
- Career trajectory (international experience opens doors)
- Tax implications (remote international work has complex tax situations)
- Social isolation (remote international can be lonely)
- Local network vs. global network

**My take:** International remote is usually financially better and great for career, but it requires strong English, discipline, and tolerance for time zone differences. It's not for everyone.

## The Post-Decision: Making Your Choice Work

You've made your decision. Accepted the offer. Sent the polite rejections to other companies. Now what?

### Don't Second-Guess

**You will doubt your decision.** Maybe your friend posts about their amazing new startup, or you see the company you rejected raise a huge funding round, or hear about someone getting promoted at the place you turned down.

**Stop it.**

Every choice has opportunity costs. You can't know the counterfactual. Commit to making your choice work rather than wondering "what if."

### Maintain Relationships

**Send gracious rejection notes** to companies you turned down:

"Thank you so much for the opportunity. After careful consideration, I've decided to pursue another role that aligns more closely with my current career goals. I genuinely appreciate the time and effort your team invested in getting to know me, and I hope our paths cross again in the future."

Keep those bridges intact. Tech industry is small. That hiring manager might be someone you want to work with in the future.

### Prepare for Success

**Between accepting and starting:**
- Learn about the company and product deeply
- Refresh relevant technical skills
- Set personal goals for your first 90 days
- Read Chapter 7 on maximizing your first year
- Get rest—you'll hit the ground running

### Set Up Success Metrics

How will you know in 6-12 months if you made the right decision?

Define your success criteria:
- What skills will I learn?
- What impact will I have?
- What relationships will I build?
- How will my career progress?
- How will my quality of life be?

Check against these metrics periodically. If you're way off track, it might be time to reconsider—but give it at least 6-9 months before making judgments.

## The Long View: This Is One Step, Not Your Destination

Here's the perspective I wish I'd had earlier in my career:

**Your next job is not your last job.**

The average software engineer changes jobs every 2-4 years. You'll probably have 10-20 different roles in your career. This decision matters, but it's not life-or-death.

**What actually matters:**
- Are you learning?
- Are you building your network?
- Are you developing skills that transfer?
- Are you happy enough to sustain this for a reasonable period?
- Are you moving toward your long-term goals?

If yes to most of these, you made a good decision. If no to most, you might need to course-correct—and that's fine too.

**The best engineers I know didn't follow perfect linear paths.** They took risks, made mistakes, tried different companies and roles, and eventually found their stride. Your career is a portfolio of experiences, not a single bet.

## Key Takeaways

Let me bring this home:

1. **Evaluate offers across five pillars:** Compensation (total comp, not just salary), Growth (learning velocity matters more than you think), Culture (you'll spend half your waking hours here), Company stage (match risk to your situation), Life factors (personal circumstances matter).

2. **Understand true compensation:** Include base, bonus, equity (valued realistically), benefits, and lifestyle factors. Calculate total comp, not just salary.

3. **Value startup equity at 20% of best-case scenario** for decision-making. Don't bank on lottery tickets.

4. **Always negotiate.** Almost every offer has room. You're leaving money on the table if you don't.

5. **Culture and growth often matter more than compensation,** especially early career. Optimize for learning rate, not just earning rate.

6. **Trust your gut.** If something feels off about the manager, culture, or company, listen to that signal.

7. **Match company stage to your risk tolerance and career stage.** Startups aren't inherently better or worse than established companies—they're different.

8. **Don't optimize only for immediate salary.** Consider the 2-5 year trajectory. Where will this role take you?

9. **Consider your personal situation honestly.** Single with no dependents? Take risks. Have family? Prioritize stability. No shame either way.

10. **Make a decision and commit to it.** Stop second-guessing. Make your choice work rather than wondering about alternatives.

## Final Thoughts

Weighing job offers is part art, part science. The frameworks in this chapter give you the science—the systematic way to evaluate and compare opportunities.

But don't forget the art—your intuition, your unique circumstances, your personal goals. The best decision is the one that fits YOU, not the one that looks best on paper or that your friends would choose.

I've accepted offers I later regretted, and I've turned down offers I sometimes wonder about. But every decision—good or bad—taught me something and led me to where I am today. Your journey will be the same.

**Trust yourself to make a good decision, commit to that decision, and make it work.**

Now go evaluate those offers like a pro, negotiate like you deserve, and choose the path that excites you. Your next adventure awaits.

- Read Chapter 7 for how to maximize your first year once you've accepted
- Check Chapter 9 for building your brand long-term
