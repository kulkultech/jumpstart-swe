# Chapter 1: The value of internship

What I want to say here:

- I want to share how important it is to get an internship. Whether you're planning to be successful at your dream company or you want to create your own company, landing internship and how to get the most out of it would be very important to shape your career.
- One of the internship-hack I've done is doing a lot of 1-1 with senior member of the company. Even though you're only an intern, having 1-1 with senior member means you create connection with them as well as learn from their experience.
