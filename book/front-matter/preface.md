# Preface

## Why this book created

Let me start with a story. When I was in college, I have no idea what life after college looks like. For example, I never plan for an internship, in fact I don't know what is an internship in the first place until I saw all my friends going to internship at a reputable company except me that goes only to laboratory for an internship. At that time, I think there's no different until I accepted at Microsoft Indonesia for a 3-months internship. Yes, it is so much different! We'll discuss more the different the first chapter when I discuss importance of internship.

Similar to what I experienced with internship, I want discuss everything I wish I know when I was in college or in high-school to bootstrap my career in software engineering and in general. If I knew what I'll discuss here, I'll be a dozen years ahead. I consider myself already few years ahead of my peers, but having more speed and power in your career is always good things. In this book we'll discuss basic principle (the why), technical tips & tricks (the how), and what are the things you can do (the what) to accelerate your career in Software Engineering field, especially for the audience in Indonesia.
