# How to contribute

## Prerequisites

		$ brew install pandoc

  To learn more you can read the [Pandoc documentation][Pandoc]

## Understand the build system

First you need to understand our build system. We're using pandoc to convert markdown into ebooks. Here's what you need to build the book.

        $ make # this will create epub file
        $ make clean # this will clean up the generated book

## Repository Structure

The book content is organized in the `book/` directory:

- `book/front-matter/` - Contains the foreword and preface
- `book/chapters/` - Contains all chapter files, numbered sequentially (00-11)

Each chapter is in its own markdown file, making it easier to work on individual chapters without conflicts.

## Editing Content

To edit a chapter:

1. Navigate to `book/chapters/` directory
2. Open the relevant chapter file (e.g., `01-internship.md`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run `make` to build the book and verify your changes

To edit front matter:

1. Navigate to `book/front-matter/` directory
2. Edit either `foreword.md` or `preface.md`
3. Run `make` to build the book and verify your changes

## Adding New Chapters

If you need to add a new chapter:

1. Create a new markdown file in `book/chapters/` with the appropriate number
2. Update `build.sh` to include the new chapter in the correct order
3. Update the chapter list in `README.md`
