## Why this book created

Let me start with a story. When I was in college, I have no idea what life after college looks like. I never plan for internship, in fact I don't know what is internship in the first place until I saw all my friends going to internship at a reputable company except me that goes only to laboratory for internship. At that time, I think there's no different until I accepted at Microsoft Indonesia for a 3-months internship. And yes, it is so much different! We'll discuss more the different the first chapter when I discuss about internship.

Similar to what I experienced with internship, I want discuss everything I wish I know when I was in college event at high-school to bootstrap my career in software engineering and in general. If I knew what I'll discuss here, I'll be dozen years ahead. I already few years ahead of my peers, but having more speed and power in your car always good. In this book we'll discuss basic principle (the why), technical tips & tricks (the how), and what are the things you can do (the what) to accelerate your career in Software Engineering field, especially for audience in Indonesia.
